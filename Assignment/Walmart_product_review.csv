Melrose Ave Women s Faux Leather Crossband Slide Sandals,HilC,3/3/2022,"These sandals look just like the picture! Great for the hotter months. A very slight padding on the bottom. I do have a higher than average arch so the top of my foot rubbed onto the straps a bit too much for my liking, but I'm thinking if you don't have a high arch the rubbing might not happen to you. Still love them though!"
Melrose Ave Women s Faux Leather Crossband Slide Sandals,Jojo,3/3/2022,"These slides feel great on and they look nice, I really love the green color that goes with pretty much any color. They're not heavy but feel well made. My mom tried them on and loved the feel of them, she has bunions and these felt really nice on her."
Melrose Ave Women s Faux Leather Crossband Slide Sandals,MaryjoB02,3/3/2022,"Fit is great: comfortable, no catching of toes, padded footbed, stays on without problems when you walk. I like the flat heel, and there is plenty of traction on the sole while still remaining a dressy shoe. It does look and feel like leather. Olive is a unique and pretty color."
Melrose Ave Women s Faux Leather Crossband Slide Sandals,Karenc,3/3/2022,"These sandals are so pretty, so comfortable and fit me perfectly. They're true to size and not too slim. The olive green color is really nice and makes the sandals more versatile so you can wear them with shorts, a dress or even jeans! Really nice."
Melrose Ave Women s Faux Leather Crossband Slide Sandals,Cocochies,3/6/2022,"Melrose Ave Vegan Leather Crossband Slide Sandal is a simple and stylish summer sandal. The faux leather crossband is soft which makes it very comfortable to wear. The olive color is very nice and it will go well with a lot of outfits. I've only use it in the house so far but hopefully it won't give me blisters if I start to use it for long walks. I love it that the crossband design is wide enough to hide my bunions which makes it even more comfortable to wear. The size was right on, it is also very lightweight, good for regular and wide feet."
Melrose Ave Women s Faux Leather Crossband Slide Sandals,PingPong,3/4/2022,"I got the green leather sandals and I must say they are pretty cute! I am a true size 6 and it fits well- although for some it might feel like it runs smaller since there's no ""spare"" width nor length. Try sizing half size up if you need a comfy lax fit"
Melrose Ave Women s Faux Leather Crossband Slide Sandals,Nikkib714,3/16/2022,"I really like the Melrose Ave Vegan Leather Crossband Slide Sandals. They are fun and really cute for spring and summer. The green almost sage type color is my favorite part about them! You don't tend to find them that color all the time and It's one of my favorite colors. They are very lightweight and you could wear them while dressed up or just for casual wear also. The only thing I wish is that it was made for wider feet because they are a little tight on mine but they also, after wearing them in, may change. I'm very pleased with them and definitely would recommend them."
Melrose Ave Women s Faux Leather Crossband Slide Sandals,RJR435,3/14/2022,"I love the olive color of these slides and living in Florida, I live in these kinds of shoes with maxi dresses, Capri pants, etc... These sandals are very pretty but unfortunately run a little wide and my feet kept feeling like my ankles were rolling. I usually wear a medium width and that's what these are but I think they would be better suited for a wider width foot. When I first got them I did notice the slightest bit of cushion but after one wearing, I can honestly say that I have other flats and slides that offer more cushioning that lasted. These just felt very flat after only wearing for a few short hours and became very uncomfortable so for looks I give them a 5 but for comfort, a 3 for rating and I would recommend. I think it's rel..."
Melrose Ave Women s Faux Leather Crossband Slide Sandals,BargainShoper,3/7/2022,"Cute sandals. I like the olive green color and it's sure to blend with anything in my wardrobe. The crisscross design is stylish and it was easy to slide my feet into these sandal. There is some cushioning; but not enough to comfortably support my feet walking for a long time, or in a rough road. The sandal fits me true to it's size."
Melrose Ave Women s Faux Leather Crossband Slide Sandals,leeny,3/11/2022,"The good size first. The sandal looks exactly as in the picture. Very beautiful grass Green color. The style looks classic on my feet. But to my disappointment, The sizing Is too small. I can't fit my feet in because They're also very narrow. The sole Is thin and hard to walk around."
Melrose Ave Women s Faux Leather Crossband Slide Sandals,WildMonkeyMom,3/7/2022,"I got these to have a pair of flat, non-boots to wear on the rare occasions I have to dress in more than jeans and a t-shirt. I am disabled and I have severe skin nerve issues that make any synthetic material feel like a billion tiny pokers are biting my skin. I don't know exactly what vegan leather is made of, but it bites my skin, too. Finding nice looking clothing and shoes with nerve issues, at least like mine, can be, well, nerve racking. I was hopeful these could work for me, because they are cute, but no luck."
Melrose Ave Women s Faux Leather Crossband Slide Sandals,SherBear,3/6/2022,"Not only are researchers sandals so cute, they are actually very comfortable too! I especially love the soft feel of the vegan leather, does not feel like plastic or hard material. They are conformable right away and did not hurt my feet at all. I especially love the green color that I got, it can be a neutral color and matches almost everything! They fit true to size as well!"
Melrose Ave Women s Faux Leather Crossband Slide Sandals,Edjmed,3/7/2022,"I think these are so cute. The sole is more comfortable than I expected. But the straps are tight on my foot which has a very high instep. If this is a problem for you, these might not be a good choice, but for everyone else I recommend these sandals."
Melrose Ave Women s Faux Leather Crossband Slide Sandals,Mommyof2,3/7/2022,Very cute slippers. They're true to size and color is exactly the same s the picture. Very comfortable as well. The color is very unique and happy to have bought it.
Melrose Ave Women s Faux Leather Crossband Slide Sandals,Oreosmom,3/18/2022,I love these shoes. It goes great with all sorts of outfit. Especially during the spring and warm weather. The leather feels great against my feet and is very comfortable. It is very modern and stylish
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,patsina,5/13/2020,"I FINALLY have enough room for all my stuff with writing space on both sides.  I'm being careful because the maximum weight load is 100 lbs.  The CPU is the heaviest item, about 15 lbs., and I placed it directly above the left legs. I would recommend this table to family and friends."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Shirley,8/21/2020,"This table has exceeded my expectations in versatility and strength.

I was skeptical at first but it has held steady (for 7 mos now) 3 monitors, one 17"" screen dell laptop, a desk pad, a phone and my basic desk supplies!! I was looking for a decent, affordable table to serve as a temp home desk since I'm working from home due to COVID and this table has delivered.

It doesn't fit my decor but it's certainly meeting the need and it'll be versatile in the future. I highly recommend it."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,bp717,9/28/2021,This is the 2 nd one that I've bought it's a really nice and sturdy table and the price is really great. If your looking for a 6' table this is a good one to buy
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,GrannyNanny,8/7/2016,Durable at a fair price.  I'm using mine on the patio for my succulent planting.  Brought all my work up to table level making it perfect for propagating and decorating.
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Tbarbaris,10/18/2016,Used this table for my first vendor event and it unfolds and folds up very nicely and very easy to set up! Highly recommend and love the handle to carry it! Only weighs 28lbs so not too heavy!
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,HillcrestCreations,7/5/2016,The table is easy to open and extend the legs.  It was a bit difficult for me to then stand it on its legs.  Moving it before setting up is a bit of a problem.  It is heavy for me but then I'm 67 and disabled.  I do like how the table looks.  It worked great at a recent craft fair.
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,sandi,4/16/2020,"This is my second table like this. The reason I like it is due to the large size, ease of setting it up, the clips to secure it closed and the handle to help with carrying it around or moving it.  Wouldnâ€™t get any other kind."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Jessica,8/18/2020,I ordered this table for a birthday party I was having and when i opened it up it had a dent on the table. I just wasnt happy about the inconvenience of having to take it back and get a new one. Other than that it seems like a sturdy table. I havent used it yet.
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,dennise,5/25/2021,This purchase was good but however when I received it there was damage at the middle of folding area and it had a few scratches on the table itself. Looked used but could just be a result of poor packaging and/or shipping handle. Besides the damage it served its purpose
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Mallory,7/6/2021,"Amazing tables but the shipping damages them!  I ordered 4 of these tables to the tune of $200 and every one came in damaged beyond use.  I'm talking bent up sides, bent middles and gouged areas from being thrown around in transport.  Some literally look like someone took a hammer to them!  Now I've got to deal with trying to get a refund and find new tables that I need in less than 2 weeks. So frustrating!"
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,MobileInstructor,4/20/2021,"I purchased this table to add to my home office setup! I really like the portability of this product, size, durability, and color. The color coordinates well with my computer equipment and accessories.  After reading some reviews and viewing some pictures, I was absolutely convinced this item was for me!"
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Ziggy1,7/22/2021,I really like this table.  It is well made and sturdy.  It has a handle for carrying after folding in half.  I am currently moving and needed a table surface to hold my boxes.  I will take this table with me to my new apartment and use it for larger gatherings with a nice table cloth.  Sweet deal.
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Lexi,11/30/2021,I just ordered a few tables and needed another one. Just opened it up and there was a dent. Table is still functional just annoying!
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,David,5/12/2020,Quick easy shipping. Setup easy. Much higher quality that the other Walmart brand. Using it as a temporary home office desk while in quarantine.
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Liz,5/10/2020,This table is nice and Sturdy for this great price ! Very is to set up and store away !! Plan on buying more !
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Whitlie,6/7/2021,"Feels very cheap made. Table came damaged on one of the ends where table folds. The clip on side of table that helps keep table together when folded, looks very worn out. It's also not lined up correctly."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,MD,5/19/2021,Sturdy! I bought one just to check the quality. And my order just came today and very surprised about it. I decided to order me another 2 table right before making this review. Very satisfied customer. I recommend this product!
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Madison,6/2/2021,"SO EXCITED to receive this table! It is a major staple in our household. I have found that this table ALWAYS comes in handy! We love using it for tailgating, yard parties, extra storage, etc!!!"
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Brittney,6/18/2021,This folding table is exactly what I needed for extra table space when we have gatherings. It isn't very heavy and folds in half so it doesn't take up much space when storing. The table top material is plastic making it easy to clean!
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Liana,9/14/2020,"This table is perfect in creating a work station if you have to work from home.  I got the color black, which really blends in with overall look of the home as well as the electronics."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Wanda,5/6/2020,When I receive my table it's have a damage in the left side of the table in the joint. Have a numb. I was very disappointed with that I take a picture that night when I receive the order for a future reference. When you buy something you expect to receive in great condition cause it is new article. I buy it because I need it and I want it. And I waiting long time to got the money to buy it so I expected it for a new great condition Cosco table. Very disappointed!!
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Rosek,4/7/2020,Worked great for my pop-up home office. Itâ€™s solid and stable with lots of area
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,pam,4/9/2020,Not the sturdiest but great for price.  Need a cheap work from home desk.
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Lenny,8/13/2021,A detail description about the table is unwarranted...  its nice and just what I was looking for.
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Shawn,6/11/2021,I needed tables that were easy to move several times a day. These are lightweight and easy enough to move from place to place by one person.
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Chr1scv,4/17/2021,I love these tables. Very convenient for setup and sturdy. I have used them for virtual schooling and birthday parties.
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Amy,5/5/2020,Love it. Perfect for my needs. Using it as a crafting table and I have plenty of room. Its very sturdy too. I was worried about that.
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Tanya,8/10/2020,"Item arrived damaged at the fold, buckled a significant amount. I ordered two of these tables and it was clear that one was already used just by the lack of packaging such as no plastic wrapping and no foam spacers. I will be contacting them for a replacement. Also this one is uneven at the fold all the way across. I needed this table now and at this point it seems like I will have to send it back and await a replacement to be shipped out."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Hunter,7/11/2020,"Item arrived partially damaged, poorly put together and the table top was not formed correctly. Customer service was a joke and took 3 times trying to return to finally get them to send me a label. Now I've wasted my time and still don't have a table to use. Time to go to Amazon."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Survy,10/22/2020,"I am using this table as my office desk at home. I have been working from home for the last 7 months using my dining table. I decided a needed a change, so I ordered this table. It was delivered next day and I am super happy.  It fit my 2 monitors, laptop and office supplies. I love the black color."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Sue,10/15/2020,"My table was delivered today. The entire corner is caved in. The table was filthy and scuffed. It looks used. The actual design is nice and it folds up for easy storage. It's also fairly lightweight. My advice would be to buy one in person so you can check it out first. I ordered online, and had mine delivered. I will probably put a cloth over it anyway when I use it.  But I'm disappointed it is in such bad shape."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Amit,1/27/2021,"I was looking for a 30""x60"" table for setting up a workplace at a reasonable cost. None of the standard wooden computer tables were fitting the size requirements. So after searching around I found this and ordered it after looking at some reviews. The table came in folded and it easy to carry (though heavy). I have put my 16 inch laptop on it, a screen, a keyboard, mouse and some books. Even now I have a lot of space to keep my writing pad, coffee mug, and more. I don't have to worry about desk space any more. I would recommend this if you have space in your room and want a comfortable work setup."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Mollie,6/13/2021,Classic folding table. Sturdy and fresh just what I needed!
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Decarlos,4/8/2021,It's working pretty good very strong and stable table
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Kalynda,4/24/2021,The table would've been great had it not come damaged today. I will be returning it tomorrow.
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Deee,5/19/2021,It came out damaged in the middle.
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,HYPPOLITE,5/31/2021,Received damaged and used.
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Sharon,4/26/2020,Perfect! Very sturdy
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,ethel,8/4/2020,I got a black folding table and love it...
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,leah,9/6/2020,It's a good size .We have it set up for the kids school like books and for their laptops . Like the durability and easy to put away .
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,WMshopper55,2/9/2021,"Pretty good light duty table that I added for extra desk space in my office.  It seems to be a little ""high centered"" , see the photos.  This is not a big concern to me but if it is to you, i would opt for a higher duty table"
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Linda,11/24/2020,"The table is good, very sturdy.  What I was disappointed in was the shipping.  All the shipper did was put a piece of tape around the table and a shipping label.  the table looked like it had been dragged across the bed of the truck."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Naman,2/22/2022,"The table is very sturdy. It is not level, and goes like 1 or 2 degrees higher along the folding line in the middle. We use it as a dinner table, serves the purpose well. 
The QC looks kind of shabby. There are minor scratches and kinks all over it. It doesn't look used, just manufacturing errors."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,trisha,5/8/2021,Slashed on table top
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Sharon,5/14/2021,Came dented.
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,dansdiz,4/18/2017,"4/18/17  I ordered two of these tables as I set up at flea markets most of the year. They were delivered to me today . I highly recommend these tables..not super heavy for an old gal like me, very well constructed, wider than I expected , has a carrying handle which is a big plus, opens and closes easily.   A fitted twin bed sheet fits just great over the table top.   You will not regret purchasing these Cosco tables. * If the pictures come out ok  they show with a twin sheet covering the top."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,VARYA,8/31/2017,"Product delivered to me first time was having lot of dents. So walmart team place replacement order and provided second table after 1 week. Second table is also having 1 small dent. But i am okay as the pickup and drop service takes so much time that i can bear with this table. I checked same product in walmart store, it was wrapped in a cling film but the table i received it was not. But at the end cost matters. I dont have vehicle therefore can't do anything."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,S,3/29/2019,Picked up 2 of these tables today. Both damaged with big dents in the center part of the table. Scratches all over with dents in them. When you buy new tables you expect to get new undamaged products. Very upset by this. Will be returning and looking else where for better quality.
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Sister,10/10/2019,"I really needed something cheap and easily moved as a temporary place for a new computer and printer.  Now that it's here, I sure wish they had offered a 4-5 foot model.  And after reading several mentions of dents in the middle, which mine also has, I really wonder...are they made this way? Table definitely needs a way to lock it in the middle instead of the 'rings' on each end near the legs.  
If nothing else, I will have more than enough room to eat a meal and work at the same time.  But jic, I think I'm going to try and find something heavy that can lay flat across both sides.  Not sure I trust it to place a brand new computer on."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,JAY,9/29/2020,I was hoping that this would NOT be defective. It looks USED!! DISAPPOINTING
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Renee,7/6/2020,The middle of the table goes upwards so not a flat surface the middle end was dented and there are bubbles throughout the table. Not worth 50$
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Dasaradha,10/22/2020,The product has scratches on sides two sides of the table . Its hard scratches. Very disappointed about the product.
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,C,9/20/2020,"Item arrived damaged, with part of the shipping box missing.  Three phone calls to Wal-Mart with no resolution."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Markisha B,4/27/2018,I needed this table for a vending event and it was the perfect size! It also arrived ahead of the quoted delivery date which made it even better!
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Taylor,8/22/2020,"Not only was my order late, but it arrived damaged. See photos attached for what it looked like when I took it out of the box."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Patricia,9/9/2020,I ordered two of these tables. Pretty disappointed that both tables were bent in the same place. The shipping boxes showed no damage.
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Alena,1/8/2022,"I have bought this table for the New Year's event celebration. I have cooked a lot and my family enjoyed each dish that I put on this table. At first, it was a bit uneven but I think as long we will be using this table, as better and flat it will be. This table is very lightweight, simple to assemble, and very good to fold for keeping. You can use it in your home when you need or you can take it with you if you do plan to spend time outside: camping, street party, and so on). Don't use it as a holder for heavy items, not as a ladder, or don't stand on this table."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Michelle,1/2/2022,"Bought this for an office table. I normally buy the black folding table with the faux leather top that's much cheaper, but wanted to try something different. This one produces a lot of static electricity. I've zapped my laptop several times now and had to take my computer apart just to reset the battery. So, I wouldn't recommend it for an office. Not their fault at all. Why I'm giving this 3 stars is because the table doesn't lay flat in the middle where it folds so you can't set anything on that part of the table, which is awkward."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,DMG,12/8/2021,"This table was exactly what I wanted. It is very sturdy and easy to set up, and even has a latch once folded and ready for storage. The table top is thick and since it folds for storage it takes less space and easier to store Thant a table that doesn't fold."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,,7/4/2016,"Ok, this 6' table only cost me $38.88 and then I had purchased a table tennis to go (at a different store) for $14.99.  We are looking at a total of $53.87 of table fun for all ages!  With creativity this table has many uses."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Theodore,6/13/2021,"I figured this would be a good deal for the money but on second thought no. Delivery was on time but there was a huge gash in the side of one box. The other box was unscathed. I opened the box that was damaged and noticed a huge dent in the top of the table. The second table was fine. Even though these tables look nice, they don't seem very sturdy at all. I am using these tables for a BBQ event in my back yard and was hoping to put these tables in the grassy area. On concrete, they are still wobbly and if you put any type of heavy pressure on them, the table my buckle or collapse in the middle. To be on the safe side, don't use these tables for anything really heavy and evenly distribute the weight along the whole table."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,awesome,11/7/2020,"Has a huge dent in it, box was ripped bad."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Torie,9/27/2020,Nice table for price. Wish I would have just purchased in store as it was damaged when shipped.
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Sheila,10/10/2020,Im using this tale as my office desk and it's perfect!
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Jou,8/4/2020,Soft plastic type material. Melted in sun . Disappointing
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Israel,8/5/2020,This table was actually better than I expected. Very nice
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Amy,1/18/2021,The item arrived with a visible dent on the table.  Otherwise it's a solid product.
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,AJ,3/18/2022,Came quickly and in good shape. Amazing price and very sturdy.
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Montrelle,7/22/2020,Table is dented in 4 different areas on the top.
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Madmom,9/12/2020,"Very sturdy, not wobbly , love the fact it folds for easy storage, shipping was very fast"
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,CindyS,12/13/2016,My daughter has one of these tables and when she brought it for an event it was so convenient with the handle to carry and it folds in half for easy storage and transport.   I mediately had to have one because my old band quit table is so heavy and doesn't fold like this one so  it won't fit in most vehicles.    This table is easy for me to manage without any help I just love it it would be definitely buy it again
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,mrujoint,3/21/2017,"This table is a great buy!  Sure fit the bill for me when I needed extra table space as I was packing up my office for my move across town to a new office.
Hard to go wrong and the handle comes in very handy when carrying it around.
Buy it, you'll like it!!
Brad"
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,DarrellH,2/19/2017,"Love the table. It is great to have an extra tabletop when those unexpected surprises pop up or for a planned event at home. It's a plus that it folds away quite nicely when not in use as well. 
Ordering and pick up were super quick. Love to order online from Walmart."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Krismllr,7/17/2016,"I ordered four tables for my shop and two of them had dents in the middle where the tables fold and one was missing the handle to carry it. As other people mentioned, there is a rise at the center of the tables. None of these things were deal breakers for me, so I kept them."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Kristen,1/9/2017,"Excellent table!!! Same table listed on Amazon for double the price! Great deal! Hand carry strap makes it easy for carting up and down stairs from basement to party area. We used these for our Christmas party and set up took less than 2 mins
For two of them!! The folding option makes storing the table a breeze and takes up half the space! Sturdy and easy to assemble! My only regret is that I didn't buy these sooner!"
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,BestMom239,9/5/2016,I bought two of these tables because lots of family coming over.  They were light enough for me to pick them up for Wal-Mart and put in my car but strong enough to hold the food and stand up to a lot of bumping from little ones.  With the handle they are easy to carry and put in my storage area off of my deck.
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Anonymous,9/2/2016,"These tables were just what we needed for quick setup and takedown for occasional classes.  We ordered 25 and they arrived on time. The only issue we had is that 6 of the 25 had noticeable deformities (usually a dented corner), since they are made of hard, molded plastic. I was able to exchange 4 of the 6 tables at local Walmarts."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Darcy,8/2/2021,"The tables themselves are good, especially for the price, but both of mine arrived in banged-up boxes and with dents in the table surface. I needed cheap tables for my market booth, so this is still acceptable to me, but no one wants to pay for a brand-new item and receive something damaged. One corner is caved in, which means I can only have one side face out and it is still visible with a tablecloth on. Other reviews noted that the tables arrived damaged, and I had hoped that wouldn't be the case with mine, but if you choose to order these tables, best to assume that they will be arriving dented or damaged, just as many reviews have noted. If you need them to be perfect, look elsewhere. If you don't mind dents and damage, these tables wil..."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,marijean,10/24/2021,"The table is nice and sturdy.  The problem is that the first table I received was damaged, I returned it and a replacement was sent.  The second table is also damaged.  I am keeping it because is it a pain to return this laege item to the post office.  Walmart should offer store return."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,larry,9/10/2021,You sent me a damaged table. And the people you arranged to pick up the damaged table refused to take it. So itsYou sent me a damaged table. And the people you arranged to pick up the damaged table refused to take it. So its still sitting here waiting for someone to pick it
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Snowbuddies,3/9/2022,"This table has a slightly ""bumpy"" surface. I would prefer it to be smooth.
You have to push on the center to make it go completely flat."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Wayne,1/28/2022,The table does not sit level when set up. Center seam is over 1/2 inch  raised. Both halves slope down from hinged center. My floor is level.
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Sally,1/26/2022,Gave it 4 stars because it looks slightly bent in the middle but overall works well for how I need it. Would recommend.
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,LindseyR,2/2/2022,"Arrived with only cellophane wrapping.  One side is slightly bent at the middle join. Otherwise, it works like it's supposed to."

Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Deanna,8/10/2016,"Much better quality than expected.  Very sturdy, folds up to about 4"" thick so it's easy to pack with the camping gear.  I was so impressed I bought a second!"
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,hnlbruin,8/31/2016,"This table is great, easy to open and prop up in literally seconds, no dealing with the pegs and holes on the legs.  For the price, we opted to buy 4 instead of renting tables."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Rcatwoman,11/30/2016,"Purchased this for the Thanksgiving meal with my family. Originally noticed this table at my company events and seen how durable it was and easy to store. Exactly what I needed, and as an added bonus it is is very easy to set up and take down."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Karen,9/22/2021,"I'm  very satisfied. Stable, heavy duty and perfect height for my studio. It's easy to assemble and office chairs fit nicely underneath with a large even surface for drawing. Ordered another today!"
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,MAXINE,8/25/2021,"I use this table to hold my out door potted plants, I store supplies under the table.
I love this table, this is the second one I have for my back yard.
Table is sturdy, light weight and easy to move."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,palak,8/22/2021,Not really happy with the quality or delivery. The table came indented and is bending when you apply any light pressure. Feels cheap for spending this much money. Walmart would not offer a convenient replacement.
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,jess,11/12/2021,the product was fine. the delivery wasn't. the package was left at the end of the driveway  on the street  where anyone driving buy could have packed it up. fedex is a zero in this neighborhood.
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,cdarbygrl,8/30/2021,"This is the 2nd table I've bought like this. They are great for college dorm rooms. My son does his homework on the table,  with plenty of room to spread out. We also have one at home for projects and it's very sturdy.  Definitely recommend!"
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Frank,11/2/2021,Purchased a 3-pack deal but now it is listed as only one table that somehow costs over 2x the regular price? Am I really buying 1-table for $100? C'mon man.
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Dave,7/28/2021,"I liked that the tables arrived when walmart said they would, in two days. Upon inspection the tables opened satisfactorily, but I found some defects. I can live with them. I'm using the tables at the present time to set up trains for the holidays."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Gail,11/1/2021,"These tables are perfect for gatherings; not too heavy, easy to handle/carry; I can carry these without my husband's assistance and they store extremely well, fold in half.  Highly recommend them!"
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,NanaandPappyB,11/19/2021,"This is the second 6' Cosco folding table. This one is for our son-in-law for Christmas. He wanted one, so we got him one like ours. It is great for meals with extra company, crafts, sewing and lots more. It is very sturdy."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,jonathan,8/24/2021,"My table was dented all over the top, as well as bent. I decided to keep it ONLY bc I don't have a vehicle to return it. It has potential to be a decent table but only if you can get one that doesn't look like it was in a hail storm"
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Rocket,10/5/2021,"This table is excellent. Unlike some other brands, when full extended, this table is completely flat. It also has a locking notch to prevent the table from opening when not in use. Highly recommended."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Tom,9/15/2021,"Wow! This is such a great deal for under $50 and FREE next day shipping. What a deal. Was not a Walmart shopper before, but will be back for more deals! Thanks!"
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Fixer,7/29/2021,Great solution for me for setting my art/painting table in my guest room since it is sturdy and large enough to use but can easily be bi-folded into a neat slim package that is easy to carry and lean against the wall when my guests need the room
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Justin,10/19/2021,This table is great value.  Showed up as described and was ready to use right away.  Highly recommend to anyone looking for a solid table at a great price.
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Syvone,8/21/2021,These table are easy to set up and take down. The handle make it great to carry without you trying to grip the surface of the table. Super easy to clean;very stredy with holding weights. Overall great buy I currently own 6 of these.
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,MasterofReality,5/9/2021,"Overall I'm pleased for the $.  
It's ok for my uses. 
It did come with a pretty decent dent on it.  I'm not sure how
you dent plastic, but I guess something real heavy during shipping sat on it. 
It is sort of misleading about sitting on either end. 
The way the legs are designed, it's a real pain to sit on the ends, so consider it a true 4 person table with plenty of elbow room and you'll be ok. 
My main use is basically a camping ""buffet"" type table. 
Possibly a part time game/fish cleaning station.  
Shooting table.
It'll handle that kind of stuff great. 
I know, game cleaning/buffet table.  Gross.
Being that its white and plastic though, just a little mild bleach water and a brush and presto! 
Sits fairly level.  Level enough. 
I would..."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Razoroni,4/3/2021,"This is a quality folding table that is 6 feet long. The fact that it folds is a real plus, which makes storage a breeze.  I was surprised at how heavy it is, but that is not a real problem as that means it is going to hold up under normal use for many years! I highly recommend it, (I bought a 2nd one!!!)"
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Millie,5/26/2021,They're strong sturdy and versatile. Overall I like them. But I bought 2 and one of them it's defective or something happened on the transport. The support on the center part it's bent and one of the bolts bust out as you can see in the photo. Also the surface of that same table has a lot of bumps from the manufactory design under the table.
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,HappyGrandma46229,5/6/2021,"This table is very well made. Its top is made of an easily cleanable material which is a big plus. The legs are reliable and not going to collapse under weight, within reason, of course. The fact that it's foldable is fantastic, making it easy to store when not in use. This table will last for years!"
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Nevaeh,9/3/2020,
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Paul,5/4/2021,"can damaged dent in top bottom left side of table. Needed it when I received it, with no time to manage a return. I put on a cover to hide the damage. Very disappointed. It is very easy to fold and move around. Extra light weight, if you lean into it, then it will slide as if it is on coasters. Ideal for taking around on the go."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,joseph,6/18/2021,"I CUT THE PACKAGING TAPE AROUND THE BOX AND I AM STILL UNABLE TO GET THE TABLE OUT OF THE BOX. IT IS JUST TOO HEAVY. I AM 85YRS OLD AND A RECENT WIDOWER AFTER 56 YEARS OF MARRIAGE TO THE SAME WOMAN. MY 2 CHILDREN LIVE IN DIFFERENT CITIES THAN I DO AND THEY BOTH ARE MARRIED WITH FAMILIES AND JOBS. I LIVE IN MY HOUSE BY MYSELF. ALL OF MY FISHING BUDDIES HAVE PASSED ON. I JUST HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL SOMEONE SHOWS UP TO LEND A HAND. AND THEN I CAN CHANGE MY REVIEW OF ""EASE OF USE"""
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,MaryEllen,5/8/2021,"Great quality, Great Price.  I've been wanting a folding table for quite some time. After reading many reviews I chose the COSTCO brand. It is true to the photo and It's just what I wanted.  I do craft shows, and sometimes you have to provide your own table. This is perfect, not too heavy, easy to carry. 
ALSO....after reading reviews on other similar tables,  customers reported that there are other tables for sale,  showing this style/model,  but that when they got it, it was not the same at all.  So buyer beware. CHOOSE COSTCO ."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,denise,5/14/2021,"I just like the table, easy for me, I'm 68, to use as Fabric cutting table.  I can use it for other things like camping as well.  I loved the fact it is built good, but light-weight enough for me to move around.  Love the carrying-handle.  I would buy again, or another table just for camping."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Oreokattmom,8/29/2020,
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Carolyn,5/8/2021,"I wanted to pair it with a 6' table I already had for a larger workspace and was delighted it was the same height, exactly as described. But this folding table is already much easier to store and move around. It has a small latch to keep it closed for carrying.  And they shipped it for free! Yeah!"
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Bagby,4/25/2021,"The table comes folded in cardboard. I wished there were handles to help carry the box.Easy set up..Table unfolds.Legs are snapped open,pulled into position and locked in place. I liked the fold table in half because when table not in use,it can be folded with legs going up in table,fold and their is a catch to hold the table
When down it can easily be kept in a fairly small area like -under bed,in back of closet,behind the sofa.
The Table can easily be washed. It can be used outside or inside
 I have washed the table with a garden hose and no harm to table. Very sturdy, easy to open n set up or vice versa,can be stored open or closed in half."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Glenda,4/28/2021,"This table was very, very heavy. I will not be able to lift it into my car. I also thought it had a handle, but there was not a handle. I am trying to schedule a pick-up because I cannot return it myself. So far that has not gone well. Would not recommend it if you need to transport regularly."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,BBW,7/14/2021,"This is a very sturdy table. It is as it's described. The only dislike I have is since it's so big I would have perfered a handle to carry it because I use it for pop up shops and sometimes I have to carry things from my car to event space.

Other than that a good table for the price!"
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Angela,8/25/2020,Good deal
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,SarahG,4/23/2021,"No bumps, dents or scratches. They even had it at a local store and they delivered it 2 1/2 hours after I ordered! I def recommend if anyone needs it. The only reason why I am returning is because it's *just* too big enough for the space I have. I will be swapping for the 5' table"
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Lotus,2/23/2021,Very nice table.
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,IheartTX,6/21/2021,I purchased two of these for our home learning space.  There is enough room for computer work on one half and project work on the other.  They do take up quite a bit of space.  The table would also function well for extra dinner or part guests.  It does fold up and store easily when not in use.
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,CindyB,7/20/2021,"Couldn't be happier with ANY foldable table - If I had more room (I'm using it in a smaller bedroom as computer desk) I'd buy another one.  The only thing was, it is a bit heavy for me to carry upstairs to my room, but it has a strong, built-in handle that helps tremendously.  I had to get a friend to carry it upstairs for me.  Easy set-up, strong, materials are great."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,grammatoe,4/25/2021,"This is my 2nd table! I love it! I let my daughter have my first one for her outdoor family gatherings and camping and it's the perfect size! I use my new one in my sewing room and it's great! I'm tall and have a bad back so I put 8"" bed posts under the legs and it's perfect! Made really good and I highly recommend! It folds so easy and the handle makes it easy to move. Really pleased with it."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,kim,5/11/2021,The shelves were missing a leg! I don't know who to even begin getting a replacement. It's so frustrating because I love the shelves otherwise. The table is great. Walmart refunded me for the first set of shelves that they sold me but didn't have in stock somehow so I wasn't holding a grudge but now they send me a shelf I can't put together. Don't want to return the whole set because the others are fine and I need them. Any Idea what to do?
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Souplover,6/20/2021,This table I ordered was just what I needed. Easy to take out of the box and open. The table had a gash in the middle of it. I have had this unfortunate incident with Walmart deliveries before. One of the drawbacks of ordering items online. It will be to much trouble to return at this point so I will have to find something to cover the top of the table.
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,MarcieG,6/24/2021,"I bought 3 of these tables from Walmart. I love that they fold for easy carrying and storage. We use them for every holiday, event etc! We even use them just to sit outside and eat on. They are very sturdy and are worth every penny spent on them! I even convinced my neighbor to buy 2 as well! Haha! If you are looking for a good table at an excellent price, these are the tables for you!"
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Crippo,4/29/2021,"These are just the tables we need with grandkids birthdays coming up. I was going to get 2-8 footers then saw the deal for 3-6 footers and decided it to be a better way to go. One thing I missed when I looked at them is they have a 5 year warranty,works for me."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Avie,5/12/2021,"My apartment doesn't have sufficient counter space and I needed a surface to prepare dinners for those who can't help themselves. This table is very sturdy, sufficient for my needs, easy to clean, ready to set up, easy to foldaway, easy to store, and portable. If I want to go out and set up to feed the homeless, it will fit in my SUV for transporting. If you do holiday sales in the marketplace, this is ideal. Super great buy. I plan to buy a second one."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Dawn,5/30/2021,"Received a week ago. However, just opened the box today only to find the middle of the table near the end was damaged. But  it's too late  to return it as I need it for tomorrow. It's still functional, but from these types of purchases Ill go into the store."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,pennysaved,5/5/2021,"Arrived quickly, packaged well in Cosco cardboard box.  Very nice, sturdy table.   This is going to be used as my dining table when company comes.    This table would be great for displaying things at garage sales.  It folds and unfolds easily, and though a bit heavy, it can also be used for picnics or other gatherings transported in a vehicle."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,,7/11/2016,"I purchased 4 of these tables for my business. All of them were brand new in box. I opened and removed all of them from the box to be carried from my vehicle to storage. Immediately, the carrying handle on one of them broke as soon as I picked up the table to carry. The handles are pop-riveted and are not easy to repair. The plastic is easy to dent and the tables warp in heat or sun easily. Granted, they are black, so they may warp easier than a white table. But I would assume the manufacturer knows they are selling a table that will be used outdoors. I do not recommend this table unless you plan on leaving it inside and never moving it."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Barb,6/29/2016,"I needed a table ASAP,  logged on and as I am a Shippingpass Customer, I got it the very NEXT DAY!   This shippingpass is the best thing Walmart has done!   I live an hour from my nearest store and now I can shop anytime!  I love it that this table comes in black!  I live in the country and the white tables are difficult to keep clean. This black is fabulous for outside!    -B."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Pamela,8/25/2020,"I shopped around several sites and stores for a desk or table I could use for my home office. The ones I saw were either too small or the prices were much too high. I finally ""checked out"" Walmart, and am I glad I did! I ordered this table in Black and I am very happy with it. It's very sturdy, the material fits right in, the size is perfect, and the price was right!  It holds all my belongings for me to instruct my Zoom courses.  Thanks Walmart!!"
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Diane,8/12/2020,"With no end to  quarantine in a sight, it was time to convert a storage space in the basement into a home office (and hideaway from the family). This table is perfect for my computer, printer, stapler, and three-hole-punch etc. it is just the right height for the old executive chair We keep down there covered in cat hair, and complements the air mattress nearby  for naps."
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Ness,8/1/2019,The table itself is great. Conveniently folds up for easy storage. Has a handy carrying handle. Fits 6 comfortably. Unfortunately it was damaged when I received it.  I did not return it however as I was using it for a party the day after I received it. I definitely recommend the table but you may want to buy it from the store.
Cosco 6 Foot Centerfold Folding Table Black,Kehau,11/26/2021,Used this as a â€œhome officeâ€ desk. It fit 2 monitors a printer AND ALL those other work desk stuffs! Threw in a plastic â€œ3â€ drawer organizerâ€¦VOILA!!!

GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Southernsugarbaby,3/12/2022,It's a great product the only negative thing I can say is it's a toe breaker if you're going to buy a bed skirt buy one with a 14 inch drop. I purchased some rubberized shelf liner and some Panduit clamps from Lowe's and you can see in my picture what I did to avoid breaking my toes.
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,CarlsLady,5/1/2020,"Absolutely LOVE this bed!!!! Easy to assemble, NO SQUEAKING, and I kept my box spring and it's higher! Loved so much I ordered the 18in for my 13 year old! Great Quality as well!!"
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Judy,7/2/2021,"Great product! I like the height. Easy to assemble, sturdy. Great service! Orders consistently arrive ahead of delivery date. (We put the casters underneath. They are not included.)"
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,GrandmaSusan,2/22/2022,"Sturdy bed frame.  Went together without much trouble.  Wish the bolts weren't metric, as most of my tool are not.  Also need a rubber malet for persuading."
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Gamingforever,2/20/2022,"The bedframe is sturdy, well constructed and easy to  put together!  It arrived quickly and packaged nicely in a box with all of the hardware, tools and instructions to put it together.  I was needing 2 bed frames. I ordered the queen size first to check out the quality and craftmanship.   After receiving it, I ordered a second one in king size.  These are very nice and the price was nice too!"
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,ElizabethS,1/8/2022,"Seems like a solid frame. I put it together with my son, for his room. If I can do it anyone can but it would be a bit harder without someone to hold the pieces. Can still do it I'm sure.  Got the Gap home metal headboard and that looks super cute. Frame is ready with holes for a headboard."
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,RoRo,12/12/2021,If you are looking for a Queen bed frame that is sturdy and easy to assemble don't pass this one by. Look at the directions and match the descriptions with the correct pieces before you begin to assemble it. It's so easy a 72 year young woman (can do) did it! I only needed help to lift the heavy mattress...HA! Love it!
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Brenda,12/30/2021,"I have no complaint at all about the bed frame because it sturdy, easy to put together once you get the middle section attach to thr bed frame, bed slate are great and  price was reasonable. I replaced my wood sled bed with this bed frame but I kept my headboard for decoration purpose.  I am very happy with my bed frame"
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Sashatiggr74,5/17/2018,"I actually ordered a full bed frame so not quite sure why I got a queen. My oldest son had a loft bed and when we moved, he didn't want it put back together so he slept on the mattress on the floor. Since he has gone off to college, my middle son has taken over and I wanted him off the floor. Unfortunately the room is a small room. I was hoping that lifting the mattress up, we could use the under bed area for storage. It's a good height to store things underneath. With the metal bars, you need a thick mattress to go over it. The mattress we have is only a thin one. When I was painting the room, I stepped on the bed and thought I was going to die as I had stepped between the bars. My son and the cats don't seem to find it uncomfortable thoug..."
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Lyn,11/18/2021,"This is supposed to be a king sized bed frame, but the length and width are over 9 and 7 inches too long.

I'm accumulating bruises on my shins daily due to this defect.

Will be returning!"
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,janet,1/10/2021,"Very sturdy, doesn't slide, has a spot in the place to put a head board if you wish to. Only thing is if you decide to use your box springs with the mattress, you might need something to stand on to get up. It's pretty high, so I to my  bad box springs off and used mattress only and its perfect now."
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Phyllis,10/2/2021,"I already got it.  It was very easy to put together and I had a wonderful night on it.  I do not need  a third mattress.  I bought it because the website said that they could not say when I would get it.   It is a very nice piece of equipment.  Very sturdy, but lets the mattress do its own thing. Please ensure the website says when something is coming or not."
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Stacy,9/11/2021,"Easy to assemble, good height( my platform ankle boots slip right underneath) :) very happy about that, sturdy no squeak like they advertise. The only thing I ding one star off of it is the corners being pretty ""sharp"". I anticipate my shin getting hurt from it because it does stick out about an inch from the mattress. In any case, I am satisfied with my purchase"
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Tera,8/29/2021,"The product itself is great. It's not very aesthetically pleasing. You really want a bed skirt to go on to cover up the ugly black steel legs. If you aren't using a box spring, that proves pretty difficult as it shifts around a lot. The instructions were difficult. It's literally just pictures, no words. Some of the pieces were stickered wrong. Keep in mind too, for moving purposes, it's not able to be broken down easily. You literally have to take most of it apart screws and all to be able to transport it without transporting it whole. The product itself is good though. Not aesthetically pleasing, but no squeaking and extremely sturdy.. extremely supportive as well, no sore back in the morning!"
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Pamela,1/22/2022,I ordered this item twice and both times there were parts missing. There is a manufacturing issue. I had to return the item both times because it is was unsafe without these parts.
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Barbara,2/19/2022,I bought this for my 18 year old son. He likes it very much and says it is sturdy. He put it together without any problems.
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,james,2/22/2022,Fit together without issue.  Easy enough that 1 person can assemble it.  Tools required were included!  Good value.
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Jamy,4/30/2020,This frame makes the bed ALOT higher then I was expecting and honestly I LOVE IT! It was super easy to put together and it's sturdy. Very happy with this purchase!
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Maribel,9/8/2021,I love this frame! It's sooo sturdy and clean line. I love it. My son is 6'2 and 300 lbs and it holds him so well. Mattress don't buckle and he sleeps like a charm.
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Savannah,9/27/2021,Very nice bed frame! Easy to put together! Only complaint is my mattress isn't quite big enough so there is steel beems on both sides showing. But the frame itself is SO GREAT
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,disappointed,7/28/2021,I haven't had this that long and one bar has bent and today the leg in middle of bed bent and now middle of the bed is sagging. My kid isn't that big this is so not worth the money. very poor quality
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Bonita,8/24/2021,I have purchase two of these platform frames for my guest rooms. I was able to assemble them myself and i like the height so i can easily store totes underneath.
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Maura,6/25/2021,"So easy to put together! It took my half of a catfish episode, with a destructive dog! Absolutely no squeaks and tons of space for storage! I already had a box spring so I used it and it fits and works out great! Highly recommend, especially for the price!"
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Robynn,7/26/2021,"I love this bed frame! Easy to put together and you don't even have to hunt down your own tools because it comes with all you need. 16 metal bars across the fame and a middle bar going the length of the frame. Regular bed frames don't have that. I thought I'd still want my box spring but I don't need it. Also, when I roll over...no squeaky springs! This fame has made my crappy mattress much more comfortable and I feel well rested when I wake up. I even bought one for my son and he loves his, too! We highly recommend this frame and for the price, you cant beat it."
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Patricia,6/29/2021,"I love you clean look at this frame! Assembly instructions are easier to understand, and package comes with all tools you only need. It does take time, it took me 2 hours by myself, but everything went together pretty easily. I love the height, and sturdiness of this frame. There is a little bit of a lift, which causes the nose slip feature. You do not need hot springs with this ring, but I have a memory foam mattress, so I kept my box springs which makes the bed sit really high off the ground, which is fine with me to help keep the dogs off the bed. Attaching a headboard was easy as well."
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,,4/24/2021,"I'm a pretty heavy woman, I've gone through quite a few traditional box springs, so far this bed frame has held up to me sleeping and sitting on it. My boyfriend put it together, and if you follow the directions, it comes together pretty quickly. There's no unevenness or lifted bars. We have a mattress and a memory foam topper, but found it's been more comfortable to put a buffer between the mattress and bed frame..we used a sheet of wood."
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Loisanna,7/15/2021,"While this bedframe does take 2 people to put together it goes together easily and can be done in 20-30 minutes.  The only additional tool you may need is a hammer since, if your frame is like mine, some of the slats did not quite go in all the way.   The frame is well built, sturdy and looks great.  It is well worth the price.  My sister likes it so well, she is thinking about getting one as well."
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Kathy,2/17/2022,Works great and easy to put together
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,jmalon2455,4/15/2020,I have bought 2 kinds on here and this one is the best . The other one was horrible. Definitely worth the money

GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Lobo14,6/7/2021,"I really like this design compared to the others I've seen in this price range, this is definitely sturdier. it was easy to put together, folds in half if you need to move it, and I like the square frame over some of the other rounded versions."
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Pamela,7/18/2021,"Love this bedframe.  Only thing I didn't like was the package of screws weren't labeled .  I'm a senior citizen, and was able to put it together myself pretty easily"
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Marianne,7/21/2021,I did not keep this bed frame. It was delivered quickly and is well built but it is 14 inches high and I have a box spring and mattress. It would have been too high.
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Amy,7/19/2021,"It is an average product. Putting together was easy, I did it by myself. But the pockets to hold the slats are inconsistent in sizes, some slats cant go down all the way down into the pockets."
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Mary,6/22/2021,14 inch was WAY to high so I returned it and purchased the normal 8inch.  Easy to put together and take apart but VERY high.  Needed a ladder to climb into bed.

GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Frugalwizard,9/27/2018,"Finally, after all of my guestroom renovations have been completed I got the opportunity to set up the Queen sized GranRest 14'' Dura Metal Bed Frame that I was asked to review through the Wal-Mart spark review program. I was anxious to see it all put together. Assembly was a breeze, just a handful of screws and a couple of bolts and nuts was all it took. The simple diagramed instructions were easy to follow and the job was done in 20 minutes. The one downfall to this packaged bedframe is the poor quality of tools they include in the set (made in China). Do yourself a favor and take 5 minutes to get a standard Allen key and proper wrench, your knuckles will thank you. The basic medium brown painted coating of steel frame well finished with ..."

GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Barbara,4/25/2021,Love the firmness of this frame. Do not like where the legs are . You stump your toes all the time. Hate that.
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,WinterBoy,5/5/2021,"This is a good, sturdy frame with plenty of clearspan space underneath for storage. Perfect for those foam-only mattresses."
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Amber,4/19/2020,This was a great to assemble. Took some time at first but all came out very well! I may decide to get a headboard

GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Tim,4/21/2020,I would not suggest this unless you have a lot of thick padding or a very thick mattress to use with extra padding . It makes your mattress very stiff and hard. But it is a perfect height.
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Tywana,5/8/2020,"This frame was easy to set up. I was afraid that I would get bent pieces because of previous reviews, but there were none. It was strong, but I cut about 2 inches (length and width) off my old bunkie board to put on top. Overall very happy with my purchase."
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Linda,3/19/2022,"This bed is great! I'm a 70 year old woman and was able to put is together by myself. I like the fact that I don't need a boxspring for it. The only thing I don't like is that regular bed skirt does not fit. Luckly I can sew , so I'll just make myself one."
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Minkgirl,4/22/2020,"Only giving this 4 stars because the directions were very vague. None of the parts were labeled, but it wasn't too hard to figure out how to put it together once you look at everything. It was actually fairly easy to put together with only one person. Bed seems very sturdy."
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,NanM,3/5/2022,"After searching multiple sites, I was happy to find a platform frame that checked off all the boxes and had a great price! Not only was Walmarts site MUCH less, but this is also a more superior product than what I've seen elsewhere. Frame was easy to put together and is very sturdy. Combine that with the no-slip feature (mattress won't slip when you're sitting up in bed) and you've got a winner!

You're search is over, this is the one to buy!"
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Angelica,12/19/2020,This was a great buy for me and the delivery was earlier than expected! Really needed a new frame for our move and it only took 15 minutes to assemble. Moving it around the room is easy since its pretty lightweight but sturdy to sleep on. We love it!
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Catherine,3/7/2021,"I bought this because it has 9 legs and I wanted center support. The center, middle leg doesn't touch the ground. The manufacture must know this because the instructions address it and say to force it down if it doesn't touch the ground. That is all well and good, but then if you force it down the rails slop to the center from both sides and from the front to the back. Why would I want a bed frame that slops to the center? I had to put a piece of wood under the center, middle support to make the cross bars level. Also needed a rubber mallet because some of the cross bars were a bit too long and couldn't be put in without force. Also, it says this frame is good for any type of bed. Not so. My new latex mattress says that the bars must be no ..."

GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Sarah,2/19/2022,I bought this frame for my 10 year old as his old one got ruined in our recent move. It's extremely easy to put together and takes only maybe 30 minutes if that. It feels very sturdy and comfortable. I like that the bottom slats are pretty close together so no sagging mattress falling through. I'm larger and the bed holds me just fine as well. Really happy with this frame especially for the price

GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Dan,1/5/2021,I can feel the bars through my new mattress. I plan to add a board between the frame and mattress before the frame warps the new mattress. Not a bad product but needs something else besides bars directly under mattress.
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Benet,2/22/2021,Easy to put together with 2 people minimally. Sturdy frame even with box springs. Id recommend this to others in a heart beat. This was a great investment.

GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,tanisha,3/2/2022,This is actually the fourth one Ive purchased. One for each kid still at home. They eliminate the need for a box spring less dust mites and such. A nice comfortable mattress and you have a nice comfortable night of rest.
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Lesley,12/19/2021,Good delivery and on time. But about 2 screws were missing and the bed post couldnt fit into each other so it was impossible to put together. Bad manufacturing. Product seems to have been used and returned before and I just so happened to get it. Walmart should review the products more when they are returned before putting it back on the shelf for someone else to buy.
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Lorinda,12/31/2021,"This frame has many parts that get assembled. The frame is folded in one piece but the cross bars are all separate. The have plastic end pieces that get inserted in the cross bars but the do not fit in the pockets for them, so the frame was assembled without them. We needed a hammer to get them in the pockets. There are hex nuts and bolts holding them in. Allen wrench included."
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Punkgirl2013,3/16/2018,Was delivered today ... I love this bed frame ... my husband put it together within 15 mins very easy to do ... the metal rails in the center just slide / pop in .... I love how I have space under the bed to store some totes ... but I haven't gotten to that yet ... my bed fits nice ... I do think you do not need a box spring if you have one ... it will make the bed even higher unless you like a really high bed ... for me it's fine a fine height with out a box spring ... my cats also love the bed frame lol found them sleeping under the bed lol ... over all I'm happy and the price was well worth it
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Ebony,10/19/2021,I like how sturdy it is. Good height as well. Took me less than an hr to put together alone. Only 2 things I didn't like were the pack with the tools were not labeled so the instructions would say use g and f but you don't know what screw / nut g or f was.. but it's easy to figure out. Most of the slats did not do into the slots. I had to use my body weight to get some of them in and even with that they are not in all the way.
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Chelsy,2/24/2022,"Love!

GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,doityourselfmom01,3/7/2018,The height is perfect. It was pretty easy to assemble. Seems very sturdy. Reason for 4 stars instead of 5- the frame seems a little big for my mattress.
GrandRest 14 Dura Metal Bed Frame with Non Slip Feature Queen,Charles,5/9/2021,"Buying merchandise without seeing first and on line is not my preference. 
I am over 70 and spent over 30 years in aerospace manufacturing. I knew this was going to be a challenge. 
I was so wrong.
It was extremely simple to assemble and the precision of how the parts fit together were characteristic of the aerospace industry.
It matched all the advertised claims and has better stability than any other frame of at least twice the price.
Seriously good deal."

I must say I feel Special to have this tv. Feel like I made an accomplishment in life. I have been through a lot with my health. This was my  gift to myself! Money well spent!!!! Please buy you will NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! Thanking God for another year through all this Uncertainties and for giving me  Is Good!"
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Poolgamer,8/18/2021,"Great looking tv, works very well, colors are great and sound is towards front.  Shipment stated about 3 weeks, i think,  BUT next thing I knew a few days later it was at the door!!!"
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Good,4/19/2020,Let's just start with I don't ever write reviews but I had to for this tv it's lovely nice sound great picture and for $189. Best bang for your buck I ordered another one a 55in which should be here in a few days if your going back and forth about getting it just get it you won't regret it looks even nicer on the wall too I get lots of compliments on
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Nathan,8/7/2020,"The TV came to my house pretty promptly. I was excited to open it. Not only was I amazed by the packaging but it even included a little screwdriver with the name of the TV on it. I've never seen that before Oh, I went and bought a brand new DVD player from Walmart which I hooked up and everything looks great! I would probably recommend for anybody to get the extended warranty just because you never know with these TVs these days. But I surely hope it lasts a long time! Very pleased for the cost! The plastic is still on and im sure itll look even better with it off!"
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Currie,5/26/2021,"The TV has a fantastic picture on it which on three of its HDMI ports are capable of full 4k resolution at 60 hz. The fourth port can do 4K resolution but is limited to 30 hz but that doesn't matter as this HDMI port should be used with a soundbar that has an HDMI ARC/CEC connection. My cheap soundbar's ARC refused to work correctly (Grand Teton from Amazon) with the TV but it was an issue with the soundbar itself. The speakers built into the TV are awful like they are on most flat screen televisions. Get a decent soundbar to pair up with the unit. Also this is the only LCD TV that came as a ""dumb"" TV which I was specifically looking for. Rokus that are built into the TV run very slow and are barely usable. Grab a Roku streaming stick   to ..."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Stuart,12/10/2021,"the tv is amazing beautiful picture and the sound is way better than the 43""Sceptre that was a year old but the screan got broke fron a ball joint that exploded.  My problem is the shipping it took 8 day's past the day it was scheduled to be delivered. Walmart uses FedEx and they are slow they need to stop estimating deliveries if it is shipped with FedEx. My tv was in salt lake all of the 8 days??? Why..... i was so frustrated i was going to send it back. UPS would be much better carrier for on time deliveries. I will think twice before purchasing anything else from Walmart for big purchases i will get it from Amazon!!!  but for under $200.00 this is a very good tv and there sound problems have been addressed this tv has excellent sound an..."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,William,4/29/2020,"Price and picture are great! Not a smart Tv, but I have chromecast.  Sound is not the best. Two days after I had the Tv a 10 to 12 inch green line appeared in the middle of my screen. I contacted Walmart and they shoot me out a replacement TV hopefully this doesn't happen again."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Daximus,12/10/2016,"I didnt want to give this product one star since it may have worked perfectly had it arrived in tact. However it is worth noting that if you buy this item online there is a definite possibility of it arriving damaged.  There was a small amount of damage on the box, but not enough that I would have suspected the tv to be damaged. It comes shipped in its own packaging, there is not a larger box that the tv box is placed into.  The price was right and I imagine if it had actually made it on my wall in tact it probably would have gotten a 4-5 rating."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Joe,12/17/2021,"Ordered this TV pre-Black Friday on sale. Received quickly and was impressed with size and quality. The sound was also great. After 2.5 weeks, a random purple line showed up on the TV. The TV was not damaged, touched, or altered for the two weeks it sat on my TV stand, so was very confused by the line. I am thankful for Walmart customer service as I am able to easily return TV."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Staci,12/27/2021,"Bought this TV as a Christmas gift for my daughter during the Black Friday sales. Christmas morning comes, we get it out of the box, plug it in, and the screen is messed up. Half of the screen is normal while the other half is faded. Can't exchange it... I can only return it, and if I want to get another one I have to either A. get a smaller one for the same price, or B. pay way more now for the same size because it was a Black Friday deal so the cost was lower at the time.  I have this brand TV in my living room and love it, wish a simple exchange was possible."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,aleshia,5/5/2020,"I was always stuck on namebrand tv's. So I told myself I would try this brand due to the price. The google home that comes with the tv was awesome. It was so easy to set-up. I got the tc mounted and due to it not being a smart tv, the firestick took care of that. It shows great"
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Demarco,9/10/2020,Im preparing for the ps5 and wanting a 4K tv seeing as how the price was so low for its size I say its flaws are manageable picture ok not great screen very easy to install and view audio has 0 bass hook to any external device and your set (HIGHLY RECOMMEND)
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,DTRacing,7/12/2020,"Great picture, decent sound. Price is hard to beat, easy set up. Only complaint is that the volume tends to go up and down on its own but I think that might be an internet connectivity issue as it only does it with the Roku hooked up to WiFi vs the Blu Ray player being hard wired and it doesn't have that issue on that device."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,PawNewman,8/16/2021,"Paired this TV up with the ""onn. AC Powered Computer Speakers"". The TV has a real good picture quality, but the speakers are very bad. You will need an external speaker source to fully enjoy this TV. The picture quality was more important to me than the speakers. Can't expect much @ $200 in terms of speakers, but I'm very happy with the picture quality. 1080p is very crisp and vibrant."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,audioception,10/13/2021,This is a great 4K 50 inch item at a great price. I'm using it as a monitor for my mac Mini M1 computer. The big size is wonderful for digital audio editing software (DAW). Should be great for video editing as well. So I didn't care that it is not a smart TV. Has a usb port so you could add streaming. But I don't plan on doing that. Very satisfied. Displays via HDMI from my iPhone as well (using low cost iPhone adapter). Attached is actual screen shot using Logic Pro X.
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Tanesha,9/2/2021,It has great images with very crisp pictures and the framing and finish on it is beautiful. I didn't expect the resolution to be as good as it is but honestly it's great! If you're looking for a 4K TV that's not very expensive I would recommend this one.
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,AuntNyCee,10/26/2021,The picture tube is dimming and it's no longer connecting to the internet...i will never purchase another Samsung and will continue to always invest in the Best which is VIZIO TV!
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,juan,12/11/2016,"this is a very nice tv with a very clean image at very good price, in 4k tv nobody can beat this price but the sound is not good i need to buy a sound bar but i still like the tv"
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Lee,5/2/2020,"Love the TV for the price. Only had it a month so far but everything works great. Sharp picture, sound is ok but I have a sound bar so that doesn't affect anything for me."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,william,5/9/2020,super happy...easy to set up...great picture...using a sound bar...easier access to all the ports and stuff than my last TV.well worth the money...might get one more!
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Decent,7/10/2020,"Hooked my Xbox up and noticed a difference immediately. Absolutely beautiful picture, minus the color temp being a little off. I'll be playing with the settings to see if I can make it more even, but otherwise great budget 4k TV."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Glenn,5/14/2020,"Decent  Inexpensive entry level 4K Led tv, Nice clear picture , sound is ok if tv is in a not so big bedroom or not so big living room but if u want more premium sound I suggest a sound bar to go with tv, but price can't be beaten on it"
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Bking2010,7/8/2021,"So far I like the TV, the size is awesome, has good volume sound, great picture quality, warranty inexpensive, awesome price, this is a fantastic product to me. As important, all its features are actually implemented well. Good picture, light weight, good value for the price, inexpensive to me."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,ethelya,7/10/2021,"I purchased this TV while I was in the process of refurnishing my home (so I didn't open it immediately) The delivery driver placed the TV inside my home, and it has been in the same place since it was delivered. Physically looking at the TV there doesn't appear to be any damage, but as soon as I powered it on to set it up I was able to see that the screen is cracked."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Ashley,4/15/2021,I love this 4K TV. The sound is perfect and the picture is sharp. The only thing is that my xbox one s doesn't allow HDR10 on this 4k TV which is it's fine. And people say the sound is very poor on this TV and no it's not. I am play Resident Evil 2 Remake as Leon and the sound is very good and clear. The screen is also perfect for our den room to play our games. We had a 40 inch 4K smart TV and the screen was not very big so we put that TV in the guest room.
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Cheaps,6/13/2021,"Bought this for an outdoor setup (along with an outdoor case), so I didn't want to splurge too much right off the bat.  Got this for $203 and could not be happier with the picture and sound especially at this price.  Bought a smart soundbar to go with it, but returned it because it did not add much over the TV speakers.  Just at volume 34 it was plenty loud and clear in my backyard.  No bass obviously, so will still need something to fill out the sound, but the voice clarity is impressive.  I hope it holds up, because this will be a phenomenal buy at the price.  The plastic is still on the screen in the photos by the way."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Sunny,7/19/2021,Well I finally got the TV hooked up and all kinds of horrible colors like at the top of it like it's cracked and then then they start shooting through the middle no picture sound came on no picture just funky colors so the TV sucked but called customer service and the young man made my day and she sended me a new TV we're going to try it again didn't have any problems so the TV got a one star but customer service today the young man got five stars.
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Pha,7/10/2021,"So I recently ordered this Tv when it was on sale for $203. I was a bit skeptical because I'm use to  major name brands and never would've thought the quality just as equal. Shipping made me nervous because I mean, I'm shipping a whole 50 inch state to state but I saw  another review that said they appreciated the packing so that gave me a bit more faith lol. When I got the tv it was in the tv box. Clearly you can see it's a tv so if you're shipping to a home where it may be left on the porch you may want to consider that. But over all when I opened the box there were a lot of precautions taken to make sure the tv got to it's destination without damage so I was extremely happy about that. They picture quality is great! It definitely compare..."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Daculamom,5/28/2021,"This is the second one of these TVs i have purchaed! Great size and clear picture i'm very easy to install.

Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Mari3141,4/9/2020,"I love my new tv, the price and the quality are both great! You will not regret getting this one. The picture is crisp and the sound is awesome."

Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Mike,5/31/2021,50 inch tv for $200.00!! Had to buy it. Way better than I expected for the price being so cheap. Great picture. Sound could be a bit better but I have it hooked up to my Vizio surround with the speakers off so no big deal. Love it.
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Jacksongirl,6/4/2021,This tv is the perfect size for my entertainment center. The volume is great.

Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Oscar,6/13/2021,Was looking for a great deal for the money and for my patio. The images are high definition. I run it with my Fire Stick and I love it. No cable or satellite fees.

Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Philip,7/4/2021,For 200$ it's a bang for buck an got tivo 4k dongle for 30$ so 50inch 4k smart tv for 230$  it's a steal

Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Dmattie72,8/9/2020,Surprised by the quality of picture. We weren't looking for anything expensive as it's just for the kids. Very vivid colors when Minecraft is played. Kids are happy. No complaints so far.
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Audrey,12/21/2020,"Got the tv, unwrapped it, set it all up, turned it on, and there was a big line on the screen. I should have learned from the other reviews not to buy a tv online and have it shipped."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Gwen,11/21/2020,"I originally ordered a TV from BestBuy, but it came cracked and damaged. Returned that and waited 3 weeks for a new one, but they told me to contact UPS without a new tracking number so I got a refund and went to Walmart instead.  Excited to FINALLY have a TV and this one is damaged, too. The 1 Star is only for the speed of shipping plus TV works, but this light leak is going to bother me forever. Not worth it. Better luck buying a TV off craigslist."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Sharon,11/23/2020,"Worst experience of my life. I purchased this t.v. online for my kids and when I took it out of the box, the screen was broken. My kids were disappointed. A 50' tv and over $200 down the  drain. If you ask me, I say just go to the store and purchase a tv. None of this online trash."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,AutismMom,10/28/2020,The television was broken when I received it. I have 2 smaller versions of this television and the are very good. There's no way I can accurately rate this television. I wish Wal-Mart would offer this set in store or shipped to store. FedEx does not take care of people's items.
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Sean,11/1/2020,"For a 4k UHD tv, this product is a steal! Vibrant colors and picture quality very close to what a tv with HDR looks like. If you are looking into jumping into the 4k market, this tv is well worth the $199 price tag. Used it on my ps4 pro and it looks amazing on a vast variety of games."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Molly,1/8/2021,"Scepter seems to be known for bad sound quality. I have owned a few. We have a stereo attached to it. I had to order some sort of adapter that Scepter helped me figure out. This or a sound bar is a must. Picture quality is very good. They are one of a very few that are not Smart TVs. This is my first reason for purchasing this brand. They are very reasonably priced. Be aware, if not wall mounting, where the legs attach. On my 55 inch the legs were outside of the furniture area it is sitting on. Its not the best but we couldn't put on the legs. The first one I ordered, the screen was very cracked. I believe they must have had something happen to a shipment. A lot of people complaining about this. Thats most likely why they were so cheap, $19..."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Erica,11/28/2020,"I purchased this tv for my bedroom. The tv I had was smaller and with my failing eyesight, this was less than new glasses that don't help much anyway.  Excellent picture, sound, durability, and it stays on 24/7! I have hadv it almost a year and it was well worth the purchase! It's not a smart tv, but I didn't need it to be because I've got cable.  I love it and I use it often when I'm resting in my bed because of my back problems. It's the best tv I've ever purchased too!"
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Brandi,11/30/2020,"The picture on this tv is decent, it's lightweight, and I love that it has a USB port in the back of the tv so my Roku can be  plugged directly in instead of taking up another electrical plug space. However, the audio quality on this tv is very poor. Sounds like the speakers are inside tin cans, you can hear them vibrating the tv. I can't turn it up past 9 without it getting too â€œtinnyâ€ but I can't hear it that well at a level below 9. It's a good thing I also bought a soundbar or I'd be sending this tv back."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Andrew,10/2/2020,"for $199.99 this tv is worth every penny.
not a smart tv which is what I was looking for.
easy setup like old school, connect an antenna run channel scan and your all set. picture is fantastic, the hd over the air channels I receive look pristine not to mention the hdmi connections for dvd/blue ray/laptop."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Brian,3/28/2021,"My first fall screen was a sceptre. Then my 40 inch. Now my beautiful 50 inch baby is all mine and it looks terrific. The stock speakers were even pretty decent. Picture quality is great. The remote is responsive and the quality is all there for $200. The sceptre logo looks cool too so you at least don't look like you bought your TV from a garage sale lol. I like to save money and sceptre has always been the best price for a premium product. Just started and finished Game of Thrones on this bad Larry and it was quite a vivid, exciting ride."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Michael,12/9/2020,"I purchased the 50 in. 4 k tv. Well it was damaged straight out of the box .I never roughed it up in anyway. I was told sorry for the inconvenience, but,it was a physical thing, so really sorry for my !luck.Now that's the kind I would deal with .thanks once again."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,dewayne,9/28/2020,This has been one of the worst experiences I've ever encountered if not the worst when it comes to making an online purchase...o ordered this TV on September 21 was good it would be here on the 22nd didn't get it until the 24th. When the TV did arrive there was no picture but had a sound. I called and got a replacement that came on September 27th which was yesterday...I was so happy that the picture worked but became very disappointed when the sound didn't work. I called Walmart to let them know and they basically tell me oh well not out problem we dont do anymore replacements call the brand and let them handle it. Never ever purchase anything from them especially this brand of TV!!!!
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Junior,8/27/2020,"Ordered and got this tv within two days. Didnt take me long to notice there was a dent on the screen and once I plugged in my tv, I saw that the screen was completely busted. I read the other reviews and didnt expect this tv to last more than a few months. Did not expect it to be broken upon delivery!"
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Megan,11/15/2020,The tv was super easy to setup! The legs were marked as to which side the should be installed and the tv had the corresponding markings. The only issue I had was when screwing the legs in the holes. They do not already have a track for the screw just a hole so I would suggest screwing the screw in first then taking it out and then putting the legs on with the screw. I did this with the second leg and it went on muuuuch quicker!
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Adam,3/20/2021,I was very pleased with my purchase. The TV has a great picture and the price was great.  The only down side is the audio quality isn't the best.  It is acceptable though.  I would definitely buy another one.  This is a great buy for someone who wants a bigger better tv but doesn't have a lot to spend in one.  I don't feel they will be disappointed at all.
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Jenae,12/14/2020,"My tv was delivered broken and I ordered the wall mount installation which did not include a mount. I had to purchase a mount, pay for the installation, turned on my tv only to see the screen was broken. So now I have to try to return the tv to the store. So disappointed. Ive been waiting weeks for this tv and I probably will have to wait even longer for Walmart to replace it."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Erin,9/10/2020,No problems so far. Hooked it up to my fire stick and have been good to go ever since. I will say that I was a bit annoyed to find that the sensor is sensitive. Theres quite a few warnings in the packaging about making sure it doesnt lay flat on the screen because that can cause the remote sensor to break.
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Faith,10/20/2020,When it arrived I was concerned as there was a hole in the front of the box... The FedEx guy was kind enough to stay and help take it out of the box to make sure the screen wasn't damaged... Thank goodness it WASN'T!!! I would suggest a additional box would solve this problem... ANYWAY.... It's a GREAT DEAL!!!...Nice pic an audio...
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Jolena,11/22/2020,"We bought this tv for our outside dock at the lake.  We pour it on a motorized mount so it is tucked in on the roof when not used and lowers down when using.  With being outside and reflection of sun, it still has a great picture. We are hating as separate sound bar so not really sure how the speakers on the tv itself works"
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Den,1/24/2021,"The tv itself is fantastic. Great picture, with all the modern options for hdmi and devices. My only complaint which I can get past for a 200 dollar great widescreen ,is the sound.  Its beyond horrible. You will have to purchase a sound bar and disable tv volume in settings. All that said, still a great tv."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Aditya,2/4/2021,"It's of very poor quality and terrible customer support. About 10 months into operation it started making weird noises and stopped working.

We went through the whole process of sending it back under warranty. When it came back post warranty - it didn't work either. The screen was white and wouldn't switch the HDMI. Absolute piece of crap. 

Spend an extra $30 a buy a different brand. Sceptre is just not worth it. The teaser prices also reflect terrible quality and customer support."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Ers,12/13/2020,We purchased this television with high hopes and in just over one month it has a bad spot on the screen.  We are very disappointed and do not recommend this purchase.  If you look closely on the attached photo you can see a green line going through the tablet
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,TheseSHOIRTS,11/29/2020,"This is an outstanding television especially for the price but the only issue is it's says it comes with swivel technology so u can turn your tv from left to right but it only came with legs which don't fit my TV stand causing me to have to spend money for another tv stand but great tv, wonderful pic and great sound from just tv speakers"

Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,MIkeM,2/10/2022,"The TV stopped working today February 9th. I bought it in the middle of November when it was on sale. There was no damage at all and it just sits on the cabinet. I never touch it because it has no control buttons besides a power button on the bottom, so I have no reason to. I came home for lunch, played a game and turned it off as usual, and no I don't rage throw controllers when I lose. After work, I turned it on and it flashed black and came back on with just big vertical bars but full sound and control with the remote. The manufacturer says it needs repair, but I have to cover shipping cost. Which from where I live is $180 dollars before insurance...I paid $199 for the TV. Luckily I paid for the product insurance when I bought it, so I t..."

Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,wendy,11/15/2020,We ordered this TV for my daughter for Christmas.  We decided to give it to her early and I am glad we did. It is not working and broke.  I called Walmart and they are sending a new one. I will update my review after we receive the replacement.

Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,ranbunctious,11/19/2020,"Box came with a big hole in the front side.  Extremely lucky the screen was not damaged.  Display was milky and over-colored, but after adjustments and tuning to an HD broadcast, this TV was awesome."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Margaret,11/26/2020,Unfortunately could not take it out of the box until I had help today. The box was not damaged but when we took it out the screen was shattered. Need to return it to Walmart tomorrow.

Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Jack,7/23/2020,"This TV had so many problems with it. First, it arrived with a red line in the middle. Second, the pixels would cut out every couple on minutes, and it sounded like the TV was under water when playing sound. Do not recommend."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,James,8/30/2020,Arrived broken. Maybe thats why it is $199. Saw another review that had a broken screen like the one I purchased. Now I have to waste my valuable time taking it back
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Cosmetologist50,3/25/2021,The price of course but it was easy to set up and user friendly. I think the sound is fine but a sound bar may be a good addition.  I'm using it at my beauty salon. It was a good buy for 203.00! 50 inches very nice size.
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,ROBIN,3/7/2022,Bought this item 2x. Was thrilled w/ price but in less than a year I started seeing lines across the screen. Thought it was an anomaly so bought another. And guess what!! YUP lines across the screen. Save yourself $ and don't buy this product.

Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Justin,1/10/2021,The picture was great foe the first two weeks. Now there's a vertical line and a horizontal line in the screen that shouldn't be there and won't go away.
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,John,11/30/2020,TV was broken when I took it out of box . Plugged it in .  Was cracked inside ! Not screen had to be returned. Sceptre is crap tv to send it from factory unusable. Only recourse was exchange. Second one better work . Don't want to give 1 star
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Briana,7/31/2020,I would give it five stars I absolutely love the TV the picture is great only when I got it there's this weird lines going through my screen when I turn my TV on that just won't go away I think it may have been damaged during deliveryï¿¼

Get it!"
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Karen,11/30/2021,"I was very, very disappointed. I purchased a 50 inch tv and when I received it the back was busted and the tv is out of stock online and in store. I had to settle for a 32 inch for the price  of the 50 inch. Very disappointed. I would appreciate it very much if Walmart made this right and replaced what I ordered a 50 inch tv"
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Jennifer,11/29/2021,"I'm sure the TV is fine, but I ordered it online and when I received it, the screen was completely cracked (didn't notice until after I put it together and turned it on). I returned it to my local Walmart store and they were out of that tv, so I had to get a different one. The damage had to have happened during shipping. It needs better packaging to protect the screen. Walmart was really nice about taking it back at the store and getting my refund to me quickly. Low stars for packaging, added stars for the return and customer service."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,John,1/11/2022,"TV was grainy, sound quality was extremely poor, bass is nonexistent. TV broke a month and a few days after receiving (right after Walmart stops taking returns). Sceptre refuses to refund me for my purchase. I guess you pay for what you get. DO NOT BUY! You have been warned."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Nicole,12/18/2021,"The product is already broken and useless. The sound was horrible, but I was willing to deal with that. I moved the TV to a carpeted floor to clean and move the stand. The TV tipped over slightly into a plastic water bottle nearby, which somehow cracked the screen, making the TV useless. Only after 3 months. Do  not waste your money."

Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,ReturnToSender,10/16/2017,"First time using Walmart delivery and it may be my last. Spotted this TV deal and purchased it right away. Delivery time was slow and once I received and powered on my ""new"" TV, it was displaying tuning lines...similar to the static lines you would see on older analog TV. At first i thought that it was a loose connection of my HDMI cable, nope! Just a damaged TV that I waited Forever to receive. Happy I purchased the warranty. I'll be returning this. Would be a great tv (4 star) for the price if it was working correctly."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Larry,5/15/2020,"First I'll start off with what I don't like, they're contracting FedEx to ship their products and fedex is very unreliable which is why amazon has blocked all of their sellers from using fedex I got 3 day shipping it took almost 3 weeks and I had to drive 45 minutes away to pick it up TWICE because fedex couldn't find it the first time. I had to get a replacement because FedEx â€œlostâ€ the first one. The HDR does NOT work for my Xbox one. Now for what I like after I finally got it today it's in perfect condition and works as advertised. Don't believe the reviews about the speakers being low or sounding weird this tv is loud and clear no bass but typical for tv speakers. I can't believe this tv was so cheap hopefully it last I'll update my rev..."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,playerred70,5/19/2020,"I have gone thru 2 of these TVs... the first one just suddenly stopped powering on. I assumed that it had been struck by lightning because the weather was bad.
 The second one was a 50 inch , the picture stopped showing . It powers up but just shows a bunch of colors and none of the features work. Unfortunately I only had it for about 2 yrs. and I  keep reaching out to the manufacturer but they are not responding. 
please don't waste your money on this particular brand... don't be suckered by the low price."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Jeremy,1/30/2020,"This is the first review I have ever written for a product purchase at Wal-Mart.  I purchased two Sceptre televisons, this one and a 50Ã¢Â€Â HD (not 4K) tv.  Within a few months they both had major issues.  This tv began an annoying and persistant clicking and popping noise out of the speakers. The company did send a new one.  The other tv stopped displaying any image on the screen. Simply black.  I called Sceptre customer service and they told me the one year warranty was over snc they could not help me.  I have never had one tv, let alone two fail within a year.  

If I could recommend anything, spend extra money for a TCL Roku tv and another brand.  Sceptre is too cheaply made and are good for about a year."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,burnettb49,4/16/2020,"Wonderful I needed an upgrade... the price was fabulous... I had to get a new tv stand the feet were farther apart than what I had .., but that all worked out well... it has many features in the settings .. all the plug in ports are there... size works well in my living room... was very easy to assemble.. packaged very well...it's not a brand I was familiar with but am very satisfied with the quality... thank you"
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Adam,6/7/2020,"Couple things to note:  this tv's foot print is 43 inches (from bottom stand to stand).  You will want a tv stand that is at least 45 inches across so tv is stable.  Also if you are running 4K content make sure you switch the HDMI ports to 2.0 in settings.   Out of the box the pots are 
set to 1.4.  This is not a smart TV, but for me, I didn't want a smart tv anyways.  

So far so good from what I can see!  This is my 1st 4K tv.   Rich vibrant colors, great picture quality.  I bought this tv in preparation for next generation video gaming (Xbox Series X/PS5).  I can't wait to check them out this holiday!

I also opted for he 4 year protection plan, just in case.  For the price and the quality, I don't think you could do better!"
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Bob,12/18/2019,Shipped through Fed Ex box undamaged but once TV was set up only got 1/2 picture on screen . Returned it to Local Wal Mart with no problem. As I was walking away the girls behind the counter said â€œ same thing as the others only a 1/2 picture â€œ  doesn't speak well of the product. Bought another brand and am very happy with it.
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Aiden,5/3/2020,"Bought this as a first TV for christmas. Managed to score it for only 170 bucks. For the money its amazing. Im not a critic, so the image quality is great, however it lacks in color reproduction. Not picky, so its not a dealbreaker for me, but be aware. Not the greatest viewing angles, but hey, its a 50 inch 4k TV for 180 bucks. Its not perfect, but its certainly great for the money"

Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Steven,11/5/2021,"I bought 2 of these TV's roughly a few months apart from each other. One in my bedroom is a 50"" the one on the living room is a 65"". Had them for about 2 years now. Have to say they work great. Picture quality is good the 4k looks amazing. However you need to realize you get what you pay for. Its not Vizio, Samsung,or any other higher tier brand.  That being said, I'm a gamer these TV's get USED and I mean alot. My spouse and I fall asleep to videos at night almost every night.  Never had a issue at all. HOWEVER, I will say this the audio quality is garbage. YOU WILL NEED TO BUY A SOUND BAR, OR HAVE SURROUND SOUND. I have surround downstairs and a soundbar in my bedroom.

Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Tuneupguy,11/18/2021,"I purchased this TV back in 2018 for a little over 200 bucks. The picture quality was better than I expected. The sound quality NOT so good. The speakers are facing down and not towards the viewer so I had came up with a cheap quick fix. I pulled out some plastic Tupperware and cut it in half then taped to the rear of TV and rear of half Tupperware. See photos below. Now the sound comes towards the me and not the TV stand. A short time later I purchased a speaker for movies but the plastic containers are still attached with clear tape, lol!

Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Teresa,11/22/2021,Package was undamaged. TV colors are off and no amount of adjustment seems to remedy this. Also does not seem HD / 4k.

When I finally did get someone he explained they had many people out for illness, OK, but it seemed a weak excuse.  The man with whom I spoke was helpful and effective so all is now OK, but not without some frustration."

Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,dudebaby,12/1/2021,"This tv looked great out of the box but after trying to install it and hook it up for almost an hour, the only thing that was on the screen was a bunch of colored lines. Apparently it had been dropped before it arrived at my house. What a total waste of time and now I need to figure out how to pack it up and return it to the Walmart. I was very disappointed with this tv and will never purchase another Sceptre tv."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Kit,12/6/2021,"Picture is excellent. Well packed compared to other brands in the same class. This is not a Smart TV which is actually better. It is because the hardware might last much longer than the software update just like all other operating system in the real life. The sound and remote is not that bad. After insert FireTV, I use the remote from FireTV stick most of the time."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Jerry,12/21/2021,I read reviews before i made this purchase. There were a number of complaints about the audio quality. I just don't find that to be the case. If your expecting home theater sound experience form this TV's then this is not the TV your looking for. I've watched DVDs and I find the audio very good. The audio is adjustable thru the TV settings menu. It would be more of a home theater experience with a sound bar. The display is stunning and I'm very pleased with the purchase. And yes I would recommend this TV if you looking for a Non-Smart TV .
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Jerimiah,1/10/2022,"I got this on sale for just over $200 dollars at the end of May.  It's a $200 TV, so not much should be expected, but I'd recommended spending a little more money to get a higher quality TV. 

The trim around the perimeter of the TV has a line in it at the top where light shines through.  Not a big issue unless you are at eye height or above on the TV, when I noticed it I decided it was something I could deal with considering the price and avoiding the hassle of returning the TV.

6 months later I threw out the box and packing materials it came with, thinking I'd be fine because it hasn't had any extra issues, and I needed the space.  Well about 6 weeks after that (End of December) it started making a kind of groaning/creaking noise in the ..."
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Kelly,12/9/2021,I've only been using this tv for about two weeks but I think I got a great deal on an excellent product. The picture is clear and colorful and the sound is good also. I'm impressed that it has four HDMI ports including an HDMI ARC port which made it easy to connect to a sound bar. I wish I would've purchased two of them!
Sceptre 50 Class 4K UHD LED TV U515CV U,Clyde,12/4/2021,"This is not an expensive TV ($248) and it is a ""dumb"" TV.  However, I knew that going in.  I don't need a ""Smart"" TV because I use Firesticks on all my TV's.  So, this TV is perfect for my needs.  The picture quality is plenty good for me, the sound is good and the legs are only 10"" wide so it fits on my fireplace mantle.   I would recommend this TV to anyone that uses Firesticks exclusively and that is not a picky video quality person.  Keep in mind you're getting a good TV for $248 versus $400 to $600 for a ""Smart"" TV with maybe better picture and sound quality."
Mainstays Folding Tray Table Natural 19x15x26 inch,Olsmer,4/13/2021,"I give these five stars, because these are really nice TV trays. Beautiful wood. The only problem is, I ordered four of them and they shipped them in a box stacked on top of each other, so three of them are all scratched up and cannot be fixed. I am keeping the one that was on top because it is still in good shape."
Mainstays Folding Tray Table Natural 19x15x26 inch,PattiCA65,8/20/2021,"Great table for the price.  My suggestion is to buy them at the store so that you can inspect the table tops prior to paying.  Also - I do not recommend having them delivered UNLESS they are actually being shipped from their warehouse.  I purchased 10 trays and had a partial delivery of 7 trays because one of my local stores had them in stock.  They were delivered by some random person in their personal vehicle - like UBER or DOORDASH.  The tables were put directly in front of my door which did not allow me to open the door to retrieve them. Some were laying face down, while two trays were leaning agains the wall - there was more than enough room for the trays to be placed standing upright.   Because of this, a few tables had scratch marks ..."

Mainstays Folding Tray Table Natural 19x15x26 inch,Darryl,12/24/2021,There was a giant manufacturer's sticker in the middle of the tray table that made the table unusable.  It covered about 75% of the table.  The sticker edges disintegrated when trying to remove it (see picture).  The glue used on the sticker would not come off.  I even used Goo Gone for an hour to try to loosen the glue.  Nothing would work.  I was very disappointed.  I returned the tables to the local store the next day in hopes of exchanging them for tables without stickers.
Mainstays Folding Tray Table Natural 19x15x26 inch,Anton,1/24/2022,"The table is really nice, and has a pretty finish. Unfortunately the table comes with a giant sticker on its surface. I struggled to remove it fully as it was not an easy peel sticker. It left sticker residue that was an absolute pain to get off. I nearly ruined the finish removing it all. Pretty dissatisfied with this aspect of the product as the product images show no sticker. 
I wanted to but multiple if this table worked out, but after the experience I had with the sticker, I think not."
Mainstays Folding Tray Table Natural 19x15x26 inch,Andre,2/4/2022,These trays come with big label glued to the center of the tray. It does not peel off so I either use the tray with the label or resort to more abrasive measures to reme it.

Mainstays Folding Tray Table Natural 19x15x26 inch,Vanessa,6/18/2021,I placed this order for store pickup.

I purchased 10 trays and had a partial delivery of 7 trays because one of my local stores had them in stock.  They were delivered by some random person in their personal vehicle - like UBER or DOORDASH.  The tables were put directly in front of my door which did not allow me to open the door to retrieve them.

Mainstays Folding Tray Table Natural 19x15x26 inch,Darryl,12/24/2021,There was a giant manufacturer's sticker in the middle of the tray table that made the table unusable.  It covered about 75% of the table.  The sticker edges disintegrated when trying to remove it (see picture).  The glue used on the sticker would not come off.  I even used Goo Gone for an hour to try to loosen the glue.  Nothing would work.  I was very disappointed.  I returned the tables to the local store the next day in hopes of exchanging them for tables without stickers.
Mainstays Folding Tray Table Natural 19x15x26 inch,Anton,1/24/2022,"The table is really nice, and has a pretty finish. Unfortunately the table comes with a giant sticker on its surface.

Pretty dissatisfied with this aspect of the product as the product images show no sticker.

Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Carl,8/9/2021,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have purchased numerous furniture items in my 74 years. This product was not easy to assemble but it was the best I have ever put together. The instructions were very good and every item went together perfectly. It is good quality , the price was right, and I am very pleased with it and the matching night stand."
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Ludmila,10/21/2021,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I like the design, the sturdiness and the color. I wish the edges were sanded off for safety. I wouldn't use it anywhere near children. I have their storage cube organizers - they also have very sharp corners/edges."
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,b,3/2/2022,"love this dresser! very well made, looks nice and roomy drawers. took me and hubby about an hour to put together. make sure to follow the directions correctly and its a breeze!"
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,NatO,8/4/2020,"Very pleased with this purchase, just as described in photo, using in our guest/study room, works perfectly, drawers are deep enough and this is a sturdy piece of furniture.  Exactly what we were looking for."
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Francine,5/4/2021,"All of the positive reviews are on target (at first I was worried about the quality due to the reasonable price..). It took a little over two hours to assemble, but the directions are pretty easy to follow (two of us did it). The dresser is very sturdy and the drawers slide smoothly. I love the color - goes perfect with my room which is gray/light blue. A great accent piece for extra storage."
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Christy,5/27/2021,"I love this dresser! It is a lot nicer than I expected it to be. It only took me about an hour and a half to put it together. There weren't many parts so that's a plus! The only thing I did not like was the slight chemical smell it had. I let it air out over night before putting any of my clothes in it. Also, the color I got is more of a greyish color but I don't mind it. It still matches my other decor. Other than that, very cute."
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,StaciOnline,8/21/2021,Take your time and you end up with a really nice dresser!

These are for my younger boys bedrooms and they withstand the storm! So awesome!
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Stephanie,10/1/2020,Better homes and gardens products are amazing! The price was great and the quality is awesome!

Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Cristen,2/21/2021,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] It turned out great. We needed something small-ish and easy to use for our 3 yr old daughter's ""big girl room"". It looks good and she can easily open/close the drawers. My husband put it together himself in a couple hours, wasn't too confusing/difficult. Heavy duty for the price. Hope it holds up."
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,amanda,1/22/2021,"Overall the dresser was easy to assemble; took about 2 hours for me. There are noticeable gaps between the top drawer and between the bottom drawer. The middle drawers are closer together. The top drawer catches a little but there's no way to move it down. All the holes were pre-made so nothing should be misaligned or put together improperly. I love the way it looks but I wish I could adjust it so the top drawer opened smoothly. Multiple pieces had dents in them, only one can be seen though."
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Sidnehy,4/18/2021,Took a bit to build but I love it in the end. Also durable and heavy.
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Betty,11/14/2020,It's pretty but I spent hours putting it together and the holes are incorrect and top drawer can't be installed.  The manufacturer has no customer service available on weekends.  I'm very disappointed.
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Karissa,9/22/2020,"A little bit of a pain to put together. They need to have a better way to indicate which pieces need to face up or down. The hardest part was putting the handles on with such short tiny screws. Other than that it is very solid, sturdy,"
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,HeatherS74,3/19/2022,I received two of the same legs. Letter L. So now when put together their are holes that face up front. For as much money as people spend you would think they could get this right!
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,mommy4babies,1/2/2021,Very heavy-duty (and heavy).  My husband and I were very impressed.  Has the look and feel of real wood.  I think it's just the right size.  Any larger and we would not be able to fit it next to our king size bed in our tiny 12x12 foot bedroom.
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Jackie,10/28/2020,This  dresser drawer was exactly as pictured....Thick with wide drawers...Very good quality...Super cute....Fast Delivery...Looks great on my vinyl floors....Thinking about added one of the matching pieces....(Pic seems to load upside down)

It was easy to assemble went together well. very sturdy. large solid drawers. looks awesome.  looks like alot of dissatisfied customers due to user error. ooops. follow directions word  for word and it will turn out amazing.  thinking about purchasing a few more.
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Ashley,5/16/2020,I love this dresser! The box that it came in was very heavy so I had to take everything out and carry it upstairs a few pieces at a time  It took about an hour and a half to build by myself. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s really good quality and sturdy. I love the rustic white color and it goes great with other pieces in the collection. It is bigger than what I thought from the pictures and the drawers are really spacious. I would definitely recommend this dresser.
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,meadow230,2/8/2020,Loving this Better Homes and Gardens Modern Farmhouse drawer chest. The quality is very nice. Took my husband and I about 2 hours to put it together and we are very happy with it. The drawers are very roomy and glide in and out with ease. I am planning on buying more pieces from this collection. Very pleased.
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,ErinStaley,5/20/2020,"I purchased this to match a few other items from the same collection. I love this dresser! Assembly is straight forward if you follow the directions. It took me 2 hours to assemble, but wouldve been faster with another person. The wood feels sturdy, there were no missing pieces, and it looks perfect in my room. I do suggest this collection to anyone looking to re-do or furnish a room. It looks super modern and expensive once itÃ¢Â€Â™s set up."
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Julia,9/15/2021,"I am so pleased with this piece of furniture! I looked for weeks to find the look I wanted for an affordable price but also a quality piece and this checks all the boxes. I put it together myself in a couple of hours. Directions were easy to follow and everything was labeled correctly. It's for my fiancÃ© and he is so impressed with the space, slow closing drawers, look, quality, all of it! By the dang thing! You will not regret it."
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Victoriya,10/15/2021,"So happy with the purchase! The dresser was delivered on time. It was nicely packaged. The box was super heavy though. Could barely move it. My husband was busy so I started the assembly by myself. Directions were easy to follow. All the holes were in the right places. There were no defects. I would say it took me about 2-3 hours to assemble it by myself, with my toddler constantly getting in a way. So happy with the end result!"
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,teachermom,8/9/2021,"I have purchased numerous furniture items in my 74 years. This product was not easy to assemble but it was the best I have ever    put together. The instructions were very good and every item went together perfectly.

Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Dena,11/1/2021,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this dresser because I have another piece of this line and it is wonderful. Very heavy construction, feels solid like it will last a long time. The reason I give only 3 stars is the drawer mechanism (patent pending) is miserable to just, just miserable. You make the correct you think the drawer needs, and it messes with the one above or below it. I want to love this piece, but right now I want to burn it to the ground."
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,GERARDO,3/1/2022,"Perfect size, nice color, good material. The cartÃ³n at the back is not too thick but the drawers are great."

Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Elizabeth,1/19/2021,Love our new bedroom pieces in white rustic. Very heavy and sturdy pieces. Takes time to assemble but so worth it.
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Bc,2/24/2022,Love this dresser. Very easy to put together and sturdy. The drawer bottoms and one drawer front were punctured sometime during shipping. Through the manufacturer I was able to order the parts I needed and received them two days later.
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Vernice,1/9/2022,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Perfect dresser for what we needed! Easy to assemble, took the husband about 40 minutes once he downloaded the digital instructions. It's in my little girl's room and her 32"" tv and Nintendo switch console sits perfectly on it."
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Nicole,12/5/2021,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This item arrived quickly, and without any damage. This drawer chest is very nice in person well made, but the color/tone is a bit off in person. Online states that it's ""rustic dresser white,"" but in person it's definitely more of a grey color/tone. A bit disappointing there. There also seems to be a slight flaw in the top portion of the design; it popped up and off the sides when lifted, but everything was assembled exactly as instructed."
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,LaurenE,6/4/2020,It is beautiful- looks exactly as pictured. Was easy to put together (took around two hours but was simple) with easy to follow directions. Great quality especially for the price. Drawers are deep too which is a bonus!
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Minnie,6/22/2020,No ought two of these and used it next to my husbands side of the bed instead of a side table. The drawers are deep and big and the unit itself is very sturdy. I was able to fit in two drawers what I had in four in my previous  chest. I love it.
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Sue,10/21/2021,"I like the design, the sturdiness and the color. I wish the edges were sanded off for safety. I wouldn't use it anywhere near children. I have their storage cube organizers - they also have very sharp corners/edges."

Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Andrea,10/14/2021,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I just needed something simple for the kids' room, and I was expecting mediocre craftsmanship considering it wasn't very expensive but the dresser is actually very sturdy and looks great! Dresser was packed well, nothing was broken or missing when I opened the box. Assembly was a little tricky, as it always is when you mail-order furniture but the instructions were written very clearly. I saw there was even an assembly video you could follow however I didn't need it, I was able to put the item together just using the written directions."
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Elan,11/17/2021,The instructions are very clear I was able to put it together myself but be careful while doing so because I messed up on some of the steps and the wood broke while unscrewing some things to fix my error. Also some of the Metal dowels broke off in the dresser so I had to use wood glue to make sure it would stay together. It was an easy enough fix though and even with the issues its better and easier to put together than anything from ikea
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Erica,11/15/2021,just finished putting this together..it was pretty painless...did not take as long as i thought it would..only issue one of the side panels has a bit of a split in it and one drawer bottom looks a bit beat up...all in all its a decent pc for the price
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,A.A.,8/5/2021,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] It's hard to find a narrow chest of drawers nowadays and this is a nice looking one for a small space in a small bedroom. The drawers work really well and the unit is very sturdy. I bought this with two matching nightstands and I'm very pleased, the room now looks very understated and classy. The neutral color goes with anything. Importantly, the chest is very sturdy and the drawers work perfectly. It's great that they are adjustable for leveling and distance between, but I might prefer a little wood slat between the drawers. Having said that, I'm very pleased with this one, it was a good price and even without the slats between the drawers it is very sturdy. I'm not attaching it to the wa..."
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,JP,8/26/2021,"Very happy with this dresser. Bought it after seeing in-store and although it took a while to put it together I was able to do it by myself.  It is not solid wood, but a pressed wood product that is made to look like wood. Yet, it is nice and heavy. Even though the brand is listed as Better Homes"
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Lisa,9/12/2021,"These dressers arrived in many pieces and were very well packaged. All the parts were there, everything labeled clearly and the instructions were precise. Don't try to cut corners, follow the instructions step by step. We bought two for our bedroom and we love the look and the quality of the furniture. This product is sold through Better Homes and Gardens at Wal-Mart but is manufactured by Sauder. An excellent company. And the price is amazing. We shopped through several stores and online marketplaces and these are by far the best quality for the price."

Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,ahsram36,8/14/2021,"Worst piece of junk I've ever bought.  Made from pressed wood, hard to assemble. I thought where it was from Better Homes and Gardens the quality would be there. But it also has Souder brand on the box. I should have knew better!"
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Jani,8/22/2021,"I struggled a little to assemble but if follow directions exactly you can do it. It is worth the effort.

Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Denice,10/25/2021,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Love the look and easy construction yet durability. Only recommendation is to supple a solid back for the dresser.
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Melissa,11/10/2021,Do not buy this! The top drawer will never go into place. The holes are wrong. A project that should've taken a couple hours has turned into days. It's going to the dump!!!

Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Susanne,7/15/2021,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The product is just as expected. It looks exactly as pictured, The only improvement I would want would be better glides on the drawers. They work fine but aren't as smooth as some other furniture in the house. But seriously, for this price point? It's a great deal, and put it this way, the next day I ordered the matching nightstand. I have to say, the app they send information about called BILT was the absolute best. I could not have put it together based on pictures alone, and the ease of step by step directions that you can go back and review, made it so much better. The parts are clearly identified and packaged well. The package is more than 100 lbs which surprised me, but I was still a..."
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Janet,4/4/2021,Just love the color and it's very sturdy. As we all know furniture is pricey and I was really looking for something affordable but nice looking. I read the reviews and really hoped I wasn't buying something that would be flimsy and look cheap. This is not that. It's beautiful and strong. Now I will say it comes in a LOT of parts. And although I'm sure I could have handled it I did give it to my husband to put together as he is really good at it. . And it did take him quite a bit of time to put together. But all the parts were there and all fit together nicely. So if you need to save some money and are willing to set aside a few hours of your day I highly recommend this one.
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Jess,7/1/2021,Looks super nice. Drawers move nicely and is sturdy. The paper directions are easier to follow then the app but overall it was pretty easy to put together. One complaint is that it was missing one of the bottom drawer pieces so I had to go buy a different one take the piece out and return it otherwise I would have had to take it all apart and return it. Very annoying
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Marisa,6/16/2021,"I like it, but one of the handles arrived slightly bent. They can't replace it without replacing the entire chest, which I had already built, and I didn't want to wait for another one to be shipped out, so I'll just have to live with it or find different handles. Otherwise, it's nice. Check the parts before building in case you have to replace it."
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,HeatherD,7/12/2021,"The furniture is very sturdy and good quality! It looks great! The only problem I had was that FedEx dropped this very heavy piece of furniture off at the end of my long driveway. The picture of what was in it is on the outside of the box, any capable person could have stolen it. Thankfully my husband was able to load it up and unload it into the house. This is not the first time FedEx has just left deliveries at the end of my driveway."
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,KELLIE,8/3/2020,"I had previosly purchased on from my Walmart locally, but needed a second one and they were out of stock so ordered it through the Walmart app and had it shipped to me but it seems to be a different quality and definitely doesn't match the first one as expected it to because it was to complete my son's bedroom set.  I do normally recommend this style being offered but found this particular piece disappointing."
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,FLDusty,5/13/2020,"I ordered this dresser in the Rustic Gray to match other pieces for my Master bedroom. Sauder Woodworking has hit it out of the park with this collection. The dressers are heavy weight and made precisely. Follow the directions and you'll have a quality piece of furniture when you're finished. The most difficult step was getting all the pieces upstairs from my front door - then it goes together in just a few hours. I'm 67 and live alone - if that's the case, get yourself some furniture sliders (shown under the piece in my photo) and you can even move it from room to room easily."
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Pegger,4/26/2020,This is a beautiful and good quality piece of furniture.  I first bought the dresser and a night stand in the grey and was so pleased; better than I expected. Later I ordered the chest and plan to purchase another night stand.  Highly recommend.  Worth every penny.

Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Kate,7/1/2019,This product is nice but I paid $200 for an in store box at my local Walmart and when I got home there were NO assembly instructions. I went back to the store they had no other boxes. Customer service said they could not help. Better homes and gardens transferred me back to Walmart. My husband and I spent 3 hours guessing how to put over 200+ screws and washers and it was nuts! Fun puzzle though.
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,CW,10/30/2018,"Pros: packaged super well so that nothing broke. No scratches or dents.  Looks more expensive than it is.  Drawers glide nice, had no trouble fitting together any peices.  All components were very well labeled, and the instructions were good but a little tricky at first until you get the drift.  The cons are that there are a MILLION peices.  You have to take your time or you will mess up.  It took me 3 hours by myself to do.  I was looking at the 6 drawer but I definitely not after the small with no help.  If you had 2 people one to put together drawers and one to put the rest you could be finished in an hour.  I used as a console under TV on wall because it was the perfect height and not low like a lot of the consoles.  Also, it is more gr..."

Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Clara,5/1/2019,"This fits perfectly with other things in my house. I received it in great shape and on the day it was promised. It took a little while to put together, I went step by step per the instructions.  I would recommend it to anyone that wants this look. My other furniture is very heavy oak and I couldn't match so I went with the gray farmhouse and it looks great together."

Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Genius,12/3/2020,"Beautiful dresser for those on a budget! We needed something affordable for 4th babys nursery and this did the job while still staying on trend! It took quite a while to build, but I managed by myself while 8 mos pregnant, so anyone can do it. The instructions were pretty spot on, although I disliked the drawer track installation and felt like that could have been explained better or changed somehow. I had to tweak the screws on those quite a bit for the drawers to slide properly without hitting the side, or being too close to one another. Overall Im happy with our purchase now two years in, and having gone through a move!"

Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Angie,5/11/2019,I bought two of these dressers and just put one of them together last night and I absolutely love it! It took me about an hour and half to put it together but that could've been because I was also watching a show at the same time. This gorgeous modern dresser has sturdy drawers and looks so good in our guest bedroom.
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Angie,10/9/2020,"Frame of this dresser is fine. Drawers are junk! They don't fit together right as very cheaply constructed. Put together exactly as directions stated and the front pulls apart from rest of drawer as there are no screws just cheap pressboard holding it together. I've bought many Better Home and Garden products- this is not one I would ever recommend. If it wasn't so much work to take it apart and put it back in the box, I would send it back!!"

Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,BCGCA,7/29/2020,"easy to put together.  looks better than pic.  however, drawer handles can easily break.  one handle did not fit in pre-drilled holes on any of the 4 drawers. draw handle was bent some.  when trying to bend back, handle broke in half.   now I have to find a replacement."

Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,GmaCarol,4/22/2021,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Very easy to put together. Using as a dresser in guest bedroom.
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Merrdaisy,12/15/2019,This dresser is very well made. It's sturdy and well built. The drawers slide well and it has great craftsmanship. I love how it has that farmhouse look. It goes great with my iron bed.
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Dresser,3/23/2019,"This dresser went together very easily, we had zero issues with assembly and its gorgeous in my daughter room...the drawers are plenty big enough...and sturdy...very pleased"
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,mandy,10/12/2020,"While I love the overall look of this piece of furniture: the drawer handles and the color of wood finish, it was not the easiest to put together (and I'm fairly handy). I read lots of reviews on this and they were good so that's why I went ahead and chose it, but the dresser I received has one leg that is shorter than the others so now it rocks back and forth slightly. It looks great in my room, but knowing that I spent the amount of money I did on this, I'm disappointed for it being unsteady. Maybe I got the â€œlemonâ€ dresser?"
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Farsheed,8/17/2020,"Solid dresser, Beautiful color. Very heavy package so be prepared. 
Well packed. For assembling, you need to follow the instruction word by word. Do not short cut. Everything works perfectly. I love this dresser, it looks very nice. Highly recommen it."
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Dianne,7/25/2020,My daughter will be using this in her apartment this year while she is away at college. We were very pleased with the quality. We decided to paint the handles a mat black and we really like the way it turned out. It went together fairly easily. My daughter enjoyed the directions that were online rather than having to read the handbook supplied.
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Jess,1/14/2021,"With such great reviews I thought I was getting an awesome dresser, I had bought the matching night stands which were very, very sturdy. This on the other hand was not. I had to use gorilla wood glue to keep the panels on the front. The â€œwoodâ€ color is basically stick on and has already peeled off. I would have returned except that it would be  too much of a hassle to disassemble."
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Lauren,10/2/2020,This was totally worth it! I have always had hand me down dressers and I was excited to get something new for a change. I am glad I got this because it is wonderful. Easy to assemble and the drawers slide so easy and so quiet. I also got the nightstands to match and the whole set is wonderful.
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Bummed,9/30/2020,"Very disappointed, it would look nice but the handles screws do not fit so they are wiggley
Things don't line up and the â€˜wood' breaks off when you aren't being rough. Drawers do not line up. I am throwing away because it's not even usable. Will only by from furniture store with warranties going forward 
Maybe I got a lemon with all the good reviews I've seen. I have put together many pieces before with out issue"
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,NCmom,3/20/2022,"This dresser is a great buy especially considering its price. The instructions were easy to follow and I was able to put it together without help in about 2 hours. It looks great, the drawers are spacious and the unit is very sturdy.  would purchase again!"
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Cara,3/12/2021,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] For the price, this is a nice dresser which looks like it will last a long time. It was laborious for my husband to put it together, but all the parts fit and it does the trick. Perfect size with spacious drawers."
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,alicia,12/2/2020,"This dresser really is beautiful. The instructions were easy and had funny suggestions for what to do when you take a break. The wood is heavy and well made. The drawer rails lined up and pull out easily. The ONLY reason I gave it 4 stars is because the fronts of the drawers actually pulled away from the rest of the drawer when I first put it together and pulled the drawers open.  This was easily fixed with wood glue, but I believe the manufacturer should look into this problem."
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Christina,12/3/2020,"Terrible quality and extremely cheap materials. Took hours to assemble only to discover that the drawers do not properly align (due to terrible product quality, NOT an assembly issue), there are missing pieces, and the washers for the handles do not fit at all. Two of the handles are extremely loose and the other two will not even stay on the drawer at all. Had to go out and buy new washers in hopes that they would fit the handles better than what came with the product. Now I am told I have to disassemble the entire thing and put it in its original packaging, which I do not have, in order to return it which is ridiculous considering that I was sent a defective product. Do not waste your time or money."
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Donna,3/2/2021,"I bought these dresser back in October of 2020. Very nice, but was heavy! I bought it to replace a longer dresser that I had. Only issue that I had was two months later I had to move and it came apart on me and I now have to fix it. Just replacing the cam screws is all it needs and it'll be good to go!"
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Jody,10/12/2020,"Take your time any follow the App provided. It was great help.  My Daughter and I put it together and it turned out great.  all pieces were there and fit perfect. Have the night stand and book cases coming for my daughter's room, hope all goes well there too."
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Kim,9/13/2020,"first I ordered this in White finish, and went with the reviews it was represented as a sturdy piece  , second I paid to have a handiman
come to put it together the person was a no show and no call to reschedule, I called the company number and they could not get connected with handiman, I canceled the service. My husband opened the package and it is grey also it is particle board with a thin layer of laminate, so I will return and go somewhere else."
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Evelyn,10/19/2020,"This comes with many pieces so you have to read and follow every single step of the instructions very carefully but also make sure you are paying attention to the details of each piece so you wont get confused while building it. I built this by myself at 36 weeks pregnant and I hardly messed up once (because at first I tried to rush it) so if I can build it anyone can but you really have to pay attention. I love the look of this chest and I am pleased with the size of it. I was so excited to leave a good review until the very end... when it was all assembled and I just had to screw the handles onto the drawers... unfortunately, 2 out of 4 handles have manufacture defects and the screws wont even go in so now I have to find a solution to the..."
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Richard,2/13/2021,"I purchased the dresser and the chest. It took me about 2-3 hrs to assemble each individually, the fact that the face of the drawers have nothing to attach to was going to be a problem. After assembling, each unit gives us such a hard time to just open 1 drawer. This was honestly a was of money over $600 spent, very unhappy!"
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Bella,11/23/2020,"beautiful piece. that's it. it came chipped was not too hard to get together but NOTHING worked! If you pick it up to move it the cheap thing would fall apart. Then reassemble again.  Drawers would fall apart when you picked them up to TRY and get them to fit into the cheap piece of cardboard.  I beg you, please don't waste your hard-earned money on this piece of trash. If I could have given it a -10 I would have. I am being Honest!!"
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Vivian,11/14/2020,My mom ordered this online they don't carry too many in the store but she loves it it comes in this color gray and white but she preferred gray something different and the handles are very good quality they don't feel flimsy easy to put together easy directions to read when we got the package it came in all intact in great shape feels pretty durable good quality I would say overall
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Cassie,8/14/2020,"Honestly, this is a really nice dresser for the price. Is it the most sturdy and indestructible dresser out there? Absolutely not. But is it pretty dang good for the price? Absolutely. It looks really nice and the drawers work great.

Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,NOTLONGLASTING,8/14/2019,"I absolutely loved this dresser when we purchased it. It was straight forward to put together and was quick. At first, I would've given 5 stars, however now its merely 2. The top shelve of the dresser completely caved in and when I went to open it this morning, the whole thing fell out and the wood completely cracked. and now I'm stuck with a bunch of broken wood. We have barely had the dresser forâ€‹ one month."
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,brittany,2/17/2022,Box is very heavy. Wood is soft and fragile. After 2 hours and the wood breaking i called it quits till the glue dries. Deff need 2 people to assemble to prevent breakage. Instructions and pieces make it an odd and harder  way of assembling than needs to be

Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Elizabeth,3/5/2021,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Great dresser for the price. Very clear directions for assembly. It is pretty heavy.
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,derek,5/3/2020,very nice dresser.  built well and easy to put together.  Side runners for the drawers were the most difficult thing in the assembly process.  I would recommend this dresser.  Great product and a great price!

Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,susan,4/9/2020,"Easy to assemble, but definitely utilized a cordless drill, threw away the little supplied hand tool.    Looks really nice, love the rustic gray finish.   Handles didn't match the look of the rustic gray so just sprayed painted them"
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Michelle,9/29/2020,"As described. Sturdy and nice. Was looking for a set that would not break the bank. This is a really nice piece to the set. Using for my little guy.  Also purchased the bed, headboard and the long dresser."
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Kathy,3/2/2021,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Beautiful, tall, strong dresser. Bought and use in a spare bedroom. Drawers are large enough to store extra pillows, blankets or clothing. Great addition and match to similar furniture in bedroom."
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Eliza,8/1/2020,"This was exactly what I needed! It looks exactly as described and it's pretty sturdy too. It does have some weight to it, so it's probably best to have someone to help. Overall, very happy."
Better Homes Gardens Modern Farmhouse 4 Drawer Chest Rustic Gray Finish,Kelli,4/14/2020,"Large, durable and love the look.  Can't beat the price either.

Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,Missy,8/26/2021,"This a  very comfortable bed.  If you like a really high mattress go with the 12"" it is worth it price wise.  this one is 6"" but is still really easy to sleep on and thick enough for me.  It is soft and truly a memory foam.  No springs, the real deal."
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,Mira,4/19/2021,I had movers set this up for me. It took them 15 minutes. They mention this was their first time doing this and it was pretty simple. I did notice one side was slightly higher then the other side but once we add the mattress it level pretty well.  Great for adding storage underneath the bed. I didnt do it yet but I have some stuff I will be placing under the bed.
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,Heidi,2/6/2022,"This bed is amazing guys. I was looking at more expensive beds on Amazon and I finally settled on this one because of all the good reviews. I like that it doesn't have removable slats so you don't have the problem of them slipping out when you move around on the bed. the frame itself comes in two twins and then you bolt them together with the two bolts they provide. the frame is really light and the feet lock into place. together my husband and I weigh over 600 lbs just us and our mattress is a hybrid regular mattress with a foam top. it is a really heavy mattress and this bed holds all of us and extra blankets and weighted blankets. no noise, discomfort, or moving of the frame.

This bed frame has added extra firmness since my two box springs weren't that strong to begin with. I highly recommend it. It even fit within my bed frame to perfection. Hope the pictures help. Oh! And easy to assemble. Great buy!"
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,Acie,12/23/2021,This is hands down one of the best purchases I've ever made! Bought it for my 7 yr old. Her room is only 10x10 feet and space is a big consideration. With this being 18 â€œ high I was able to place 2 large toy boxes and all of her big toys like her Barbie ambulance
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,VA2011,8/24/2016,I was really surprised at how strong the frame is. I had read previous reviews on here that stated they received it with dents. That wasn't the case for me. Stands pretty high with a biz spring and mattress. If you're on the shorter side a mattress would be fine on its own.
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,Michelle,12/13/2016,"This bed frame is just what I needed ! I had originally bought some risers for a frame I had been handed down but I could not put it together and it didn't even have a middle support that I needed for my queen sized mattress and box. So that was immediately and literally tossed out my window. I found this and ordered it right away! No need for risers either, this frame stands tall for perfect storage under (which is the original reason I got the risers). And the support bars throughout the whole thing is perfection especially for mattress with warrantys that call for that. So happy I checked out the Walmart website after all my frustration!"
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,jessica,8/25/2020,"Love it! Bought it for my son because his room has limited space and I didnt want a giant headboard and footboard taking up a lot of space. Super easy assembly! Only thing is to find a way to keep the mattress from sliding around/off when he gets on and off the bed. Other than that, its perfect! It has ample room underneath of it too, we put some buckets of toys underneath to create more room! Could also be used as a guest bed if we did get a another frame for him since it folds and can be stored easily!"
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,Jessica,4/20/2020,"I really like this frame. Being out of college with a modest amount to spend on a room in a new apartment, this was a great choice. I've slept in it for weeks with my little sister and both our weights combined is a little over 400 lbs and I've had friends over and we've all sat on it to watch tv and it's  been great. Its steady and reliable. 10 out of 10 recommend."
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,jodey,9/4/2020,"it is exactly as it says. black metal, locking legs, bolts to hold together the two pieces so they don't come apart, red buttons to unlock and lock legs. I'm so glad I made this purchase I'm going to sleep like a baby tonight! I had to get rid of my box spring due to it being broken and so my mattress has been on the floor because I can't put it on my frame, just a regular one, currently 7 months pregnant so definitely not ideal at all to be trying to get off the floor literally! I am beyond thankful the only complaint I have is that I was guaranteed one day and it didn't arrive on time so I did have to wait another additional day and was not compensated really at all and customer service was pretty rude about it. other than that I am so ha..."
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,Nightmare,5/15/2020,"This bed frame has damaged my new mattress because the welded wire ends are very rough. It is also causing unnecessary wear at the end of each wire. If you purchase this frame, be aware that you will need a board or some other kind of barrier between the frame and mattress. It put a 1 inch hole and several smaller holes in the fabric cover of my mattress. 
The frame seems sturdy but the damage to my mattress means I can't recommend it."
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,Clayton,11/23/2020,"The ends of the metal rods (see photo), on which the mattress is laid, are ragged so that they cut the fabric of one's mattress. I applied one solution (see photo) and I ask that Ino Sports fix this problem and I'll buy another frame. System would not let me add a photo."
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,Cindy,4/15/2021,Just got it today and it took 10 minutes to set up and make the bed. Quick and easy installation. Worth the money. Now I got to give Fed Ex a bad review for leaving my box by the mailboxes 2 floors down. If I didn't get the notification it was delivered anybody could have taken my box.
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,jacqueline,10/30/2021,"I laid a few all cotton blankets between my mattress and the frame. As well as turned over my 12 inch gel mattress and added a 6 inch memory foam mattress on top. Now i have a firm, slightly elevated mattress and 3 foot high bed, and it doesn't slide around on the frame. Elevated because the gel part of the mattress sinks into the slats of the frame making it lower on my sleep side. Photos show the blankets peaking out from the bottom."
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,Savannah,10/31/2021,"So me and my boyfriend broke our last bed, it just wasn't sturdy. BUT THIS ONE IS STURDY! I got the 14 inch high regular and it is awesome. It is a lot higher than you'd expect and the material is heavy!! Very easy to put together, thank God we don't have to sleep on the floor anymore"
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,Cmalloy,8/10/2021,Was exactly what I needed for my 10 year olds bed it was easy to assemble and fit right in between her bed frame. Only complaint the box was damaged upon arrival and 1 of the metal pieces was broken on the frame but I was ok with that it still serves its purpose
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,Felicia,8/26/2021,"As I was setting one up I notice broken wires/bars on the bed frame.  It was already two days late from the supposed delivery.  So when it came broken I was disappointed because overall it seemed a pretty good, sturdy quality.  I set the second one up and it was fine.  I decided to keep and not return because it was already a hassle to get it here, then down to my room, then assemble it.  I'll just get some gorilla glue to connect the broken pieces."
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,pgll,12/1/2021,"We moved into a temp apt while renovating and these bed frames were a great option

Easy set up."
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,Misty,7/23/2020,"Wow!  Great product. Super easy to assemble.  Very sturdy and well made. For the record, don't try to use a boxsprings, you will need a 6ft ladder to get on the bed (lol). See pic :-)"
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,FLOMO,7/18/2021,"I purchased this bed frame from Walmart.com about 3 1/2 months ago, along with the Slumber 1 by Zinus-Pressure Relief Hybrid Mattress, 10"", Full for my 19 yr old daughter who was switching from a twin to a full size mattress.  My husband and my daughter set up the frame together, took maybe 10 mins or less.  The new mattress fit perfectly.   My daughter hasn't had any issues with it so it is holding up pretty great.  The best part is that its 14 inches high.  I bought 2 large under the bed storage boxes that fit perfectly underneath.  My son will need a new mattress soon so I may possibly purchase the same mattress and this same bed frame in the near future."
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,Sarah,4/15/2021,"Love it. Very sturdy, easy to move... dont need a box spring. So far its been great. This would have been perfect for my college years moving so much, and having weird hall ways and stairwells to fit beds and box springs thru. I wanted the 18in but it sold out. The 14 is perfect tho. Now Ill have extra space to store bins under my bed.. the frame also has holes around it invade you want to attach head/foot boards."
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,jackal,5/30/2021,"I bought four of these they are very sturdy. easy to open and since it folds its great to move around. I was able to fit it up the attic in an opening on 42"" easily. the bed frame is 39"" when folded. Perfect height (14"") to put things under also. Delivery was quick I recommend this frame. I bought these for the grandkids, and I am 5.4 and 180lbs and it held me fine. perfect for camping not too heavy to carry."
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,Alice,5/16/2021,"This bed frame is just what I was looking for. I bought a full size foldable mattress from Amazon several months ago and was looking for a foldable frame for it. I shopped Ikea and Amazon, before purchasing this one. The price was great! Its much cheaper than both Ikea and Amazon. It arrived right on time when no damage or other issues. The set up was sooo easy. It took me all of 10 minutes. It was also very easy to break down! The quality was surprising. I slept on it the first night to test it out. I didnt feel the bars through my 6 inch memory foam mattress. It didnt rattle or squeak when I moved. I didnt attach the two frames together but it didnt move. I slept very comfortably! It stores perfectly in our attic access space.plan to take..."
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,Lawrence,6/22/2021,"Needed a platform for a short term use inside of a cargo trailer during a major event.  Ordered this thing and was pleasantly surprised.  Best of all, it folds down to 3 1/2"" thick in a box 40"" x 40"".  Rather than using a cot or foam on the floor, I'll use this platform with an existing twin bed for much more comfy sleeping."

Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,jennifer,11/20/2020,Ive purchased many of these frames over the last few years and this king frame I upgraded my king bed to...is awfullllll! Theres about 4 or 5 inches of extra frame that sticks out! I just got a brand new king mattress for the!!!!!my Guy has hit his leg on that metal too many times in the few weeks weve had it!

Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,c,3/31/2021,"My old box spring was shot, and was looking for a temporary fix.  Well this might be permanent. I sleep on a 12 inch thick coolgel memory foam matress, and have noticed a world of difference just in one night's sleep. I can't feel the bars or any part of the frame when laying down. 10/10. No more sleeping in the bottom of a u shape."

Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,ProudMomofaNursenTeacher,8/1/2020,I have a small bedroom I wanted to redo. I got rid of a big bulky twin size sleigh bed and wanted something smaller and a headboard to match a dresser. I bought the 18 inch high twin frame and used my mattress on it. I made a headboard to match a dresser and am extremely happy with the bed frame. It's a plus to have storage room underneath. I used a bed skirt to hide my storage area. The frame is sturdy and very easy to set up. I am a happy customer. I'm now planning to redo another room and will be coming back for another frame in a full size.

Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,Susan,10/22/2020,"Lightweight, but strong frame supports mattress securely.  Easy to set up, no tools needed. Love that it folds up for storage. The platform style bed is new to me, but I'm so glad I went with it. The frame design allows for ample under the bed storage for all my shoes. An unexpected benefit is that not having a head or foot board makes it so much easier to make the bed.  I am very satisfied."
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,Victoria,1/6/2021,"Ordered this not expecting very much for the price, however it actually seems quite sturdy. Only arrived a day late. I ordered this in black and so apparent chips or scuffs. Extremely easy to set up. All you have to do is unfold it and pull out the outer two legs click them into place and it's ready. I was worried about how much weight it could hold but it holds me, a child, and two dogs just fine. Roughly 350lbs. It sets a little higher than I thought it would but that is no issue. All in all if the need arose I would definitely order another one. It also folds back up decently small for easy storage."
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,PurpleJellyFish,10/29/2020,I would have given this a higher rating but the item arrived with some bent bars and one scrape mark on the powder coat with a small dent in one of the legs.  Otherwise is is easy to assemble and a nice frame.  Just wish it was not bent and scratched.
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,PleasantlySurprised,3/23/2021,"Sturdy bed frame, makes single mattress much more comfortable than the box spring did. But it is SO TALL! I didn't totally realize how tall it would be once we put the 13' mattress on it. Definitely not for short people or little kids. Plenty of room for storage, but I wish that the ends didn't have bars that prevent you from shoving totes under it that way. We have it against a wall on one side and we have a twin bed on a 15"" frame next to it on the other side (it makes for a great multi level seating area) but because of the cross bars, we can't slide anything under the bed through the ends. Not a huge deal though. Very sturdy and worth the money. The picture attached shows a twin IKEA mattress on a 15"" frame with the monster behind it."
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,KenHope,10/5/2020,"This is an excellent bed frame, it literally takes no tools to set it up, it comes as two bed frames they bolt together with wing nut bolts, sturd y and literally sets up in 5 minutes, I highly recommend this bed frame if this is what you're looking for..."
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,resunset13601,11/8/2020,"I got the frame in White and the size was Queen 14"".   The box in which it came had a couple dents in it and one spot was ripped open a little.    When unboxed,  as I was putting the frame together,  I noticed one of the wires was a little  bent. (see picture)   I think that happen in shipping because the box did come a little damaged but since it was only one wire I wasn't going to take the frame back to the store so I bent it back in place and  positioned the frame so the one wire  that was bent I straightened  is at the foot end of the bedframe  where there is less movement when laying in bed.  I really don't think it will become an issue.   Took me less than 15 minutes to have it all together with mattress on it.  So easy to assemble.  ..."
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,AshleyS,1/18/2021,"I bought this twin bed frame to use for my son's mattress, I didn't want to purchase a box spring so I knew that this was the route I would need to take. So far it's worked out wonderfully a straight out of the box all I had to do was unfold it and then unfold the legs. the only complaint that I can think of is that it does not lock in place so if you pull up on it from the center it's going to begin folding which is only an issue when trying to move the bed around."
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,melissa,10/12/2020,"We bought this platform in lieu of a foundation for our new mattress. Like many folks,, we assumed our old mattress was why we were waking up sore. Because it would be another week before the mattress arrived, and my being impatient, I went ahead and assembled the platform and put my old mattress on it til the new one arrived. As it turned out, it was our old foundation. I slept great on my old mattresses! This frame honestly provided more support than I thought it would. It also doesn't allow the mattress to shift and I can double stack my underwear storage totes. My husband and I are very happy with this purchase and have already recommended this frame to our friends and family!"

Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,Lorrie,3/10/2022,We love our new bed frame. We decided to remove the boxsprings and just lay the mattress flat on the frame.

Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,Naomi,12/22/2021,"Very sturdy 18"" tall bed frame.  It is a lot taller than I pictured with my 10"" thick mattress, but the storage room underneath is great. It was easy to set up too. I also bought headboard brackets and easily attached a headboard. Except the bolt hole for the bracket is right next to one of the support arms, so it was a little awkward to work in, but now that all is bolted together, it's very strong and sturdy. No noise or anything."

To me a bedframe like this won't lastong so use for quick purposes only this is not something you'll have for years to come maybe a good two months then I'll probably have to go to a furniture store and get another bedframe

I just moved into my house so my bed and box springs were on the floor until this arrived. You do NOT need a box spring for this frame, but I already had one so Im still using it.

Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,,5/7/2020,"Our frame was delivered within three days. I bought the queen sized, so it came with two pieces. The box is quite large, but easy to move. My husband pulled them out and set them up with ease. I did notice that one of the frames had a bend in the middle of it. However, once the matress is on top you can't feel it. Hopefully, it won't cause any issues later on. They were very easy to put together. The height of the frame is perfect, it isn't too tall or too short (I'm 5'2""). The space underneath can come in handy as well. If you're looking for a frame that is sturdy, reasonably priced, and easy to use, this is the one for you! It holds myself, my husband, our kids, and even our big dog (husky/shepherd mix).

Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,Eden,7/21/2019,"Originally i bought the 14"" Zinus from Amazon bc Walmart didn't show for platform bed frame when i searched.  I got the Zinus 14"" and it was great but this one is fantastic! Its the little details that make a huge difference!!!  I returned the other one bc i needed 2"" more space but if you look at the 2 brands the zinus has the supporting braces folding inward at a 45Â° angle taking up the storage space.  The mainstay one has the braces folding outward at maybe a 22.5Â° angle which gives you more space. The extra 4"" in height,  more vertical space under bc the support bracebut plus it was way easier to put together and let's not forget that it was much cheaper! I'm so HAPPY with this buy.

Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,JoeswifeErin,7/3/2020,I bought this bed frame about a week ago. It was delivered very fast and was so simple to set up! I waited until we slept on it for at least a week before giving my review. I LOVE this bedframe! we bought it in hopes of helping make our bed more comfortable because the basic metal bedframe with box spring was making both my husband and I wake up with our backs hurting bad. It was so bad that we weren't sleeping thru the night anymore. So I started researching bedframes and if getting rid of the box spring and using a platform frame would help and decided to try it. It really worked and we have been sleeping great for a week now! I can't believe how much of a difference there is! If you are looking into changing your bedframe and need someth...

Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,KiPe,3/9/2020,This bed is amazing. I took the doors off my closet to fit this bed inside to make my room look bigger. I love this. Heavy as all get out but worth it. Keep your box spring if you want your bed to sit up higher. My bed is now 29 inches off the ground. (Bed in a bag from Walmart as well $50)
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,Debbie,6/10/2020,"I like this bed frame, it was very easy to put together.  I would not think that 18"" would be that tall, but with the mattress on the frame it was just a couple of inches above my night stand.  There are 2 twin size frames that are attached by screws, just don't tighten them up to much as there are 2 sets of screws on the middle of the frame that match up when side x side,  and one frame will be higher than the other by about 1/2"".    I did have to take a hammer to knock one side down to get them even."

Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,RACHEL,5/20/2020,I'm so happy that I chose this option instead of buying a frame along with the boxsprings which is more costly. I am a bargain shopper so I am satisfied and it does the job!!! I ordered a twin and 2 queens and my family can sleep better and if you move often this comes into handy/helpful. Set up was easy and saved over a few hundred by shopping these on the app at walmart.com!! Other places want to rip  you off seriously.  The only thing is every here and there I stub my toes or run into the bars lol. That's the only difference just be careful but other than that I recommend!!!
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,Sggyn,7/7/2020,"I wished that this had worked for me bc it really would have been something I was looking for. It snapped on the 2nd day and snapped again in 5-6 days. The thin wires are fragile so I might need to find myself a wooden board to support it. good thing about it is, is that its convenient. When it arrives, you just unfold it and use 2 screws that comes with it. Is it worth it? Maybe for something very light who doesnt move around too much.. would I purchase this again..if the wires were way thicker and enough for supports..yes! My recommendation to this brand is to make the wires thicker. New"

The metal wires are welded across the entire frame and about half of them are super rough and sharp. I threw a light blanket over it and it caught the blanket everywhere and started destroying it. Imagine if I had tried to put a 100 pound mattress over it, it would have destroyed the mattress with the slightest movement. I don't care that the frame is only $89, it's not worth it. It's going back."
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,KB,1/15/2022,"FANTASTIC frame. We now have two and are waiting on the third. LOVE the storage underneath. Fits 4 huge sterilize tubs and 4 of the smaller ones. You unfold the frame like the vintage 1980s lawn chairs. Open each side, legs click, flip it over. Attach two sides with bolts, and you are done! Super sturdy."
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,,12/17/2021,"Purchased the queen size 14 inch frame, LOVE IT!!! It took me longer to log off my old sleigh bed frame pieces,than to to set this up and add my 14 inch mattress on top. The box is 51 pounds so I cut it free and took one piece at a time, joined both side and connected with 2 included screws and DONE :). I was planning to keep my old bed box to add a barrier between the bed and the metal but it would made it way to high so it had to go. In conclusion my the 14 inch Lucid bed and this bed frame is just perfect. I'm extremely happy it was tools free, so I highly recommend this product."
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,Toya,1/23/2022,"Gets the job done, but there are some features that I thought were included by design but aren't. First, the mattress sits on top of the frame with no grooves to hold it in place. Second, the bottom legs are positioned so that you can't use a bed skirt to hide the frame. This frame is best for a temporary sleep arrangement."
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,gkb46,1/8/2022,"It is a sturdy frame.  We used it with a blow up Twin size mattress.  We did have to secure it down because it was a little slippery, but with a regular mattress it would probably be fine. It  has a good height to it.  It worked out well for us with Holiday visitors using it."
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,,1/25/2022,"I purchased another frame at Big Lots for $50 more. Returned and bought this more affordable model. No tools required for set up. This was perfect for my son's bed. Doesn't squeak or make noise under heavy weight, which is a problem with several other metal bed frames. 

The only con - does not come with attachment to add a headboard."
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,Jenny,12/30/2021,I purchased the Full and it was so Easy to assemble! Im a 33 year old mother of 3 and it did it in 10 min because of the unwrapping and unboxing. No tools required comes with everything you need which is 2 nails they provide hold the frames together.  My 8 year old and 3 year old have been bouncing on it. Seems sturdy . Purchased the highest one. I also bough LINEN SPA 8 INCH MEMORY BED FROM WALMART THAT IS GOOD QUALITY TOO.
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,KB,1/15/2022,"FANTASTIC frame. We now have two and are waiting on the third. LOVE the storage underneath. Fits 8 of the totes we have. You unfold the frame like the vintage 1980s lawn chairs. Open each side, legs click, flip it over. Attach two sides with bolts, and you are done! Super sturdy."
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,CJR2,12/16/2021,"Very rickety. Makes metal squeaky sound when you roll over. It's designed to fold up, so the whole thing rocks lengthwise. Not stable at all. It started out okay, but after 4 months, putting the mattress on the floor was a much better option. Plus, metal cross bars started to bend toward the floor."
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,,12/8/2021,"The first bed frame I bought was great and easy to assemble in two minutes flat but this bed frame can be felt through the center of the bed. Easier to buy another frame than lug the heavy item out of the house as I will never buy some items from Walmart again bc they are sent poorly and damaged like an RCA TV, never again."
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,ktc,11/28/2021,"This frame is very sturdy and it has significant weight to it.  It took about 2 seconds to set it up---2 clicks of the legs and it was up.  If you have to set it up upstairs, I recommend 2 people, but I managed to get it up there myself with a lot of effort.  I intend to use an Aerobed on it.  There doesn't appear to be any sharp parts on it that would puncture the Aerobed, but I think I'll put down a throw over the frame just in case.  I don't see any flaws in the powder coated paint.  I don't think you'll be disappointed in this frame and I recommend it highly"
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,Romaurya,12/30/2021,"I love this bed! Its easy to assemble, all you have to do is screw both of the bed frames together and your done way to simple, its 10 year old work. it doesn't rock or squeak, or slide its really stable i have an king size and its perfect and its also foldable to travel this bed is amazing!"
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,Jannette,6/21/2020,This is the best bed frame I've had ever.  You can store large bins under it. It's sturdy and holds my weight which is over 250lbs. So far so good. I'd recommend it.
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,Sanimom,7/6/2016,Really easy to assemble. It took only 10 min to assemble 2 frames. I did not expect the frame to be sturdy but it is very durable. There is more room to store boxes underneath the bed frame. I totally recommend this product!
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,Kevin,6/19/2020,"I purchased this to put under my new Purple mattress that required a bed frame with a 600  pound weight limit.  I am very pleased with what I got, it looks great in white and allows for a lot of storage underneath."
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,JamaicaBride08,11/24/2021,Bought this frame for my RV sized queen mattress. The full size worked great with a couple modifications to make it slightly wider. Great height for storage underneath!

Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,Joyce,2/11/2022,I liked this so much! My recent purchase was my second one. The first one was a reg. twin. (this one was a extra long twin).  Very easy to set up - assembly!
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,Nakei,2/3/2022,I love the height of this and it's sturdy. Because of the height I'm able to easily store items under the bed. Allowing for no wasted space in a already small room.

Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,mojo12,3/20/2017,"Purchased this along with another Walmart brand twin foam mattress for my tiny studio apartment to create a daybed/sofa look. It has worked out PERFECT. What I love is I have tons of space underneath it (perfect height) for storage and so I've placed 6 printer paper boxes full of my stuff underneath, added a sheet to cover everything and now have a great ""sofa"" with tons of storage underneath. It's incredibly sturdy as I've had as much as over 200 lbs on one side and no creaking or noises of giving way. And it doesn't slide (it sits on laminate hardwood floors) but still light enough to move around if I need to get to the boxes underneath. Great quality product for this price. I am over the moon how happy I am with this purchase. So much be..."
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,angela,2/24/2017,It's just the right size and it's strong a enough to hold my weight of 250lb. It's so easy to put up thinks to it being folded in have and not in parts. All I had to do is unfold and Snape the legs up and put were I needed it and I was done. It's a lite heard to tack out the box being that the box flabs are glued to gather and taped but that's OK because its more protect that way. It's a still frame  / platform frame .
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,Momoffourallundersix,8/17/2016,"We bought two of these frames to replace bunk frames with wooden slats. We were concerned our 79 pound 4 year old would jump on and break the weak slat system. Not only were these easy to set up (no tools required), but they are stronger and more reliable than bunks that were ridiculously priced. The best part was that this purchase was intended to be temporary, but ended up being exactly what we needed to begin with."
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,Rachel,7/18/2016,"I really like this better than a box spring, because it is cleaner than something upholstered. It can be easily wiped down.
I like that the openness creates under-bed storage. Although another brand had a taller space underneath.
I know it will be good for moving about, whether to a different wall, room, or home. It is light-weight, but sturdy. 
One thing I'm not crazy about is the way the mattress slides a bit. There is nothing to hold it in place. However, all it ever needs is a push in the opposite direction."
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,Flybuuy,9/5/2016,"I bought the twin size frame as I needed a mattress and frame for a six month stay away from home.  I went to the local Walmart store and bought the twin size Simmons Studio Collection foam mattress, which I love, but had to order this frame via mail.  The frame is solid and well constructed and folds up nice and flat for easy storage.  I am 6' and 175 pounds and the frame makes no sound when I sit on the bed or roll at night.  It supports the mattress completely and I like the space it provides below for storage.  Highly recommended.  When I return home I shall take this with me as it will fit in my car."
Mainstays 14 High Profile Foldable Steel Twin XL Platform Bed Frame White,dmschan,8/2/2016,"Needed an inexpensive bed in short order for college-age son.  This bed frame proved to be sturdy and easy to set up and was 200 times better than the bed he had in his dorm room last year.  And when he's done with it, it will make a great guest bed.  It can be folded for storage and when needed an air mattress could be inflated and placed on it."

Sony Cyber shot DSC W800 Digital Camera Black with 64GB Accessory Kit,CreateFirst,1/5/2015,I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this camera. It is a great deal considering how reasonable the price was. It is good for beginners; not too complicated to learn. It takes great pictures as well. I wish it came with it's own memory card though. Having to make an additional purchase was not something I thought I'd have to do.
Sony Cyber shot DSC W800 Digital Camera Black with 64GB Accessory Kit,NikNaxCutsNCrafts,12/25/2018,This camera was purchased for our teenage daughter who was interested in photography. We didn't want to make too big of an investment but still wanted a quality item and we got it! Would recommend!
Sony Cyber shot DSC W800 Digital Camera Black with 64GB Accessory Kit,JB23z,2/26/2022,"In my work as an architect I use my Sony to photograph sites for new projects, interiors for my remodeling projects and to record progress of construction.  The camera is light weight, fits in my pocket, rugged and produces high quality photographs in very different lighting conditions.  I love it!"
Sony Cyber shot DSC W800 Digital Camera Black with 64GB Accessory Kit,whales352,9/26/2014,This camera is everything I expected it to be and then some. With the 20.1 megapixels it takes beautifully clear pictures pure and simple. Best buy for my money.
Sony Cyber shot DSC W800 Digital Camera Black with 64GB Accessory Kit,vanessa6297,2/15/2022,The camera is a nice compact size. I purchased this as a replacement for another camera. I liked the easy-to-use design. The menu is easy to navigate. The auto-focus can be a bit tricky but I've only used the camera a few times since I purchased it. The optic zoom is very clear. The video and audio quality are also good. This would be a great camera when on the go due to it's portability. I will add that depending on your ISO settings or lighting/environment you may need to adjust your image settings to capture the best picture.
Sony Cyber shot DSC W800 Digital Camera Black with 64GB Accessory Kit,Mick9,3/28/2015,"Bought this little Sony point and shoot to take on vacation to Ireland. It worked flawlessly. I really enjoyed that it fit in my pocket and that it is extremely lightweight. I previously carried my Canon on all trips and it was constantly in the way when not in use. Does it take as good photos as my Canon, no, but the pictures are good enough for vacation pictures."
Sony Cyber shot DSC W800 Digital Camera Black with 64GB Accessory Kit,benjamin,12/28/2020,"No complaints about the camera.

Was not sent the cleaning kit.
Was sent different brand items then the picture.  The camera case they sent is too big for just the camera and too small for the camera and the cleaning supplies. 

Also, there is no regular USB port on the camera, so I have no idea why this package has a USB card."

Sony Cyber shot DSC W800 Digital Camera Black with 64GB Accessory Kit,FormerCybershotfan,3/15/2015,"This DSC-W800 is the third Sony Cybershot camera I've purchased. The first one lasted years with great results, but the second one (a DSC-W330) had to be sent back within months for developing a streaky line that ran through the screen. It was repaired by Sony at no cost, but then within a year was useless because the retractable lens stopped working. Now this DSC-W800 has developed the same sort of streak through the viewing screen and has been returned to Sony for repair - no word yet on the outcome, but to be honest, I can't recommend Sony Cybershot due to the unreliability, even though I have taken thousands of great pictures with Sony cameras. I just bought a new GE X400 today, which does not have the retracting lens and I'm hopeful th..."
Sony Cyber shot DSC W800 Digital Camera Black with 64GB Accessory Kit,BobinNH,3/1/2015,A lot of nice features for the price and convenience of tucking away in the jacket pocket for skiing without taking the more expensive camera out in the wild. Negatives are the cold affecting battery life but can be expected in most cameras. Like it !!
Sony Cyber shot DSC W800 Digital Camera Black with 64GB Accessory Kit,awone,3/28/2015,"My cell phone has the same specs and is much better. I only bought the camera because I figured it would be better than my cell. I took both on trip and my cell pics were far better. Also, when creating videos the camera creates additional support files for each video which must be kept with the video for it to play. yuck."
Sony Cyber shot DSC W800 Digital Camera Black with 64GB Accessory Kit,DrLove,1/19/2015,"So easy to use, small and inexpensive. Got it for my wife to use in her work. Really like the wide angle setting. It takes multiple shots in succession when she needs to shoot an entire room. Just hold down the button and move slowly from left to right. It takes 5 views."
Sony Cyber shot DSC W800 Digital Camera Black with 64GB Accessory Kit,Feraltamer,4/24/2020,"Seems the camera needs to be braced against something so the image doesn't end up blurry. Looked on the camera menu for image stabilization. No go. Looked on the help guide, still nothing. My Kodak easyshare (rest its soul) did much better than this. Flash is too bright, and washes out subject."

It works well for 99% of shots with the Intelligent Auto setting.  I can adjust exposure, white balance and sensitivity (Iso) easily and qucikly for the rest. I can set the timer to a variety of settings. It takes outstanding shots in all lighting conditions from bright sunlight to moonless night.  I have essential tremors, so there will be some movement.

Sony Cyber shot DSC W800 Digital Camera Black with 64GB Accessory Kit,cyberruk,10/25/2017,"I am an educator who teaches public speaking and presentation skills. I needed an inexpensive camera that could also take video so I could record student presentations and provide direct feedback on how to improve. The Sony DSCW800 meets every requirement I have. When on a mini-tripod, the battery compartment is accessible and I can exchange the SD card simply. Compact yet providing sufficiently high resolution and good enough sound quality. The camera is light weight and does not add any appreciable burden to an already overload computer bag."
Sony Cyber shot DSC W800 Digital Camera Black with 64GB Accessory Kit,lfno,12/28/2019,"I bought this to replace a similar Sony camera that finally died.

Sony Cyber shot DSC W800 Digital Camera Black with 64GB Accessory Kit,Compucore,4/23/2015,A nice replacement camera to my old Kodak MD863 that I have put through use when making my vlogs. The only problem which is minor one is that I could find is that I cannot download the files directly on my Ubuntu Studio workstation. I have to go through downloading the video through a windows 7 based computer then transfer it over via USB. My older Kodak MD863 which was able to do so without a problem. And that one they had mentioned was for windows and Mac only. I had no problem with my older digital camera. It's ashame that this one couldn't be done with this model here. as well.
Sony Cyber shot DSC W800 Digital Camera Black with 64GB Accessory Kit,oldguy2,12/30/2014,"Still don't like the delay a digital camera always has between when you press the button and it actually takes the photo. I know it's auto-focusing and deciding whether to use a flash or not, etc. But I would rather it takes the shot I want when I want it instead of when it's ready. Kids, animals, and live action shots don't cooperate for very long."
Sony Cyber shot DSC W800 Digital Camera Black with 64GB Accessory Kit,Texie,1/18/2015,"It is more complicated than I anticipated! Have taken a few pics and most of them have turned out good.

Sony Cyber shot DSC W800 Digital Camera Black with 64GB Accessory Kit,moonman951,9/27/2014,"I purchased this camera based on previous reviews and price point.
Everything worked OK except the Movie function. When you press the button the movie is supposed to start taking movies until you press the button again. This camera had a mind of it's own and would just stop recording after 20-30 seconds. Unfortunately for me I had wanted to record my daughters wedding ceremony. It's now in for a warranty repair"
Sony Cyber shot DSC W800 Digital Camera Black with 64GB Accessory Kit,Scott78,12/10/2014,"The features are great. The camera allows the shooter to take pictures in more than one pixel rating. In auto mode the camera automatically adjusts to the light source. The only aspect of this camera that I don't like is that the shooter can't take 20M pictures in the HD screen format of 16:9, unless this is a feature within the camera that I'm not aware of. Otherwise, I would recommend this camera to anyone. Sony's strength has always been in TV sets, but they have been making good digital cameras as well. Just one word of advise, get out of the computer business."
Sony Cyber shot DSC W800 Digital Camera Black with 64GB Accessory Kit,riley8661,1/30/2019,"I bought this camera so I could take nice pictures to have on my phone because my phone camera is not the best.  Only to find out it's super hard to get the pictures from the camera to my phone because the directions the camera comes with tell you nothing.  It's been a couple weeks now and I still can't figure it out.  So I don't recommend this camera to anyone, especially beginners.  I would've rather bought a new phone or something."
Sony Cyber shot DSC W800 Digital Camera Black with 64GB Accessory Kit,Dreamfairy,9/28/2014,I bought the camera for a trip to Louisville with my Dad. It was his Korean War ExPOW reunion and wanted to take lots of pictures. My Dad is 86 years old and doesn't know much about new technology. It is easy to use and takes great pictures and videos! Even Dad was able to use it! I was able to load all the pics on my laptop and print them out for him. He loved it! The pictures and videos turned out fantastic! Thank you Sony for making an affordable camera that takes great photos n videos! It helped make the reunion a lasting happy memory for me and my Dad.
Sony Cyber shot DSC W800 Digital Camera Black with 64GB Accessory Kit,GreatMartin,12/15/2014,"Compared to the Sony cyber shot I have used for 2 years this one is bigger, heavier and more difficult to learn how to use without a full manual or CD. The manual you are given does not explain many fundamental things and, consequently, you will be running to the web site to ask questions and that's another story."
Sony Cyber shot DSC W800 Digital Camera Black with 64GB Accessory Kit,,11/22/2014,"The camera itself seems to work well. The almost total absence of instructions for use and sharing is a serious defect, as the miniaturization of controls necessitates a lot of different things operating off of any one button.
